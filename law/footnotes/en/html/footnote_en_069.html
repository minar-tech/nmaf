That is because they say, &quot;Trade is just like interest.&quot; But God has permitted trade and forbidden interest. So whoever receives an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past, and his affair rests with God. But whoever returns [to evil] - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally. (Al-Baqarah: (275)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, but fear Allah that you may be successful. (Al Imran/(130)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Usury is forbidden by the Qur’an and the Sunnah. As for the Qur’an, it says: “Usury is forbidden.” As for the Sunnah, it says: “Eating one dirham of usury is worse than thirty-three acts of fornication committed by a man. And whoever’s flesh grows from what is forbidden, the Fire is more deserving of it.” Ibn Mas’ud said: “Eating usury, its agent, its scribe, and its witness, if they know about it, are cursed by the tongue of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, until the Day of Resurrection.” (Al-Jawhara Al-Nayra, Vol. 1, p. (212). Publisher: Al-Matba’a Al-Khayriyah.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> He said: Usury is forbidden in everything measured or weighed if it is sold for the same type with a difference. The reason for this is that the measure is with the type and the weight is with the type (Al-Inayah Sharh Al-Hidayah, Vol. 7, pp. 3-4, Chapter on Usury). Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> The basis for its prohibition is the Almighty’s saying: “Allah has permitted trade and forbidden usury” (Al-Baqarah: (275), and His saying: “Do not consume usury” (Al-Imran: (130) (Al-Ikhtiyar li Ta’lil Al-Mukhtar, Vol. 2, p. (31). Publisher: Dar Al-Kutub Al-Ilmiyyah - Beirut / Lebanon.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - The testimony of a usurer who is known for consuming usury and who practices it regularly is not accepted, because consuming usury is a major sin, and it is forbidden by the text of the Qur’an, and the text came with the threat of Hellfire for it. God Almighty said: “O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied... and fear the Fire, which has been prepared for the disbelievers” (Al-Imran: 130-(131). And the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: “May God curse the one who consumes usury and the one who gives it,” and committing a major sin results in the loss of justice (Al-Muheet Al-Burhani, vol. 8, p. (313). Publisher: Dar Al-Kutub Al-Ilmiyyah, Beirut, Lebanon.</p></div></body></html></div>
