That is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what they do. And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts and not display their adornment except that which appears thereof...” (Surat An-Nur, verses 30 and (31).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> Ibn Abbas said: “Allah commanded the believing women, when they go out of their homes for some need, to cover their faces from above their heads with their jilbabs and to show one eye.” Muhammad ibn Sirin said: I asked Ubaidah al-Salmani about the words of Allah the Almighty: {and to draw their cloaks over their bosoms}, so he covered his face and head and showed his left eye (Mukhtasar Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Vol. 2, p. 114, Publisher: Dar al-Qur’an al-Karim, Beirut, Lebanon).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - On the authority of Aisha, she said: “The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, used to pray the dawn prayer, and believing women would attend with him, wrapped in their cloaks, then they would return to their homes and no one would recognize them” (Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith No. (372).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - On the authority of Umm Salamah, she said: “When this verse was revealed: {And let them draw their veils over their bosoms}, some women from the Ansar came out as if there were crows on their heads, from the black cloaks they were wearing.” Abu Bakr said that this verse indicates that a young woman is commanded to cover her face from strangers and to display modesty and chastity when going out, lest people of suspicion covet them (Ahkam al-Qur’an by al-Jassas, vol. 3, p. 486, Chapter on the Hijab of Women, Publisher: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, Beirut, Lebanon).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - (He refrained from looking at her face) “The permissibility of looking is restricted to the absence of desire, otherwise it is forbidden, and this was in their time, but in our time it is forbidden for young women” (Qahstani and others, Al-Durr Al-Mukhtar, Vol. 9, p. 532, Al-Rashidiya Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - As for our time, it is forbidden for young women, not because it is ‘awrah, but for fear of temptation (Al-Durr Al-Mukhtar, Vol. 9, p. 532, Al-Rashidiya Library). What is most correct in my opinion is what the Hanbalis have stated, that the entirety of a free adult woman is ‘awrah in prayer except for her face and hair, and the face and hands are ‘awrah outside of prayer considering that looking at them is like looking at the rest of the body (Mar’at Al-Mafatih Sharh Mishkat Al-Masabih, Vol. 2, p. 479, Publisher: Department of Scientific Research, Call and Ifta’ - Salafi University, Benares - India).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - In Al-Muntaqa: “A young woman is forbidden from revealing her face lest it lead to temptation. In our time, this is obligatory, even an obligation, due to the prevalence of corruption.” And on the authority of Aisha, may God be pleased with her: “The entire body of a free woman is ‘awrah except for one of her eyes only, in order to avoid necessity.” (Majma’ Al-Anhar fi Sharh Multaqa Al-Abhur, Vol. 1, p. 81, Publisher: Dar Ihya’ Al-Turath Al-Arabi).</p></div></body></html></div>
