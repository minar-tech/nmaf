**Batch download from bucket to local**

Using `rclone` is a good option here, especially since you've already successfully used it for transferring files between Google Cloud Storage and your local machine. `rclone` works well in Git Bash on Windows and will allow you to download all files in `nmaf_output-bucket-en` to your specified folder in one command. Here’s a suggested approach:

1. **Ensure `rclone` is set up**: Since you’ve previously configured `rclone` with your Google Cloud Storage (`gcs`) remote, you’re all set on this front.

2. **Use Git Bash**: Since `rclone` works seamlessly in Git Bash on Windows, this will likely be the easiest method to manage the command and avoid shell compatibility issues.

3. **Run the command**:
   ```bash
   rclone copy gcs:nmaf_output-bucket-en C:/Users/mikan/GIT/nmaf/law/footnotes/en
   ```

This command will:
- Copy all files from `nmaf_output-bucket-en` in Google Cloud Storage to `C:\Users\mikan\GIT\nmaf\law\footnotes\en` on your local Windows system.
- Only download updated or new files if you rerun it, preventing duplicate downloads.

If you encounter issues with permissions or network settings, the **Google Cloud SDK Shell** can be a fallback option. However, `rclone` in Git Bash should be simpler and more efficient.
