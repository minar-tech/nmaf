Who, when they take by measure from people, take in full, but when they give by measure or weight to people, give less than due. (Al-Mutaffifin: 2-(3)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - And to Madyan [We sent] their brother Shu`ayb. He said, “O my people, worship God; you have no deity other than Him, and do not shortchange the measure or the weight. Indeed, I see you in prosperity, and indeed, I fear for you the punishment of an encompassing Day.” (Hud: (84)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Tatfeef linguistically: cheating in measurement or weight. From this is the Almighty’s saying: “Woe to those who give short measure.” So Tatfeef is a deficiency that one defrauds one’s companion in measurement or weight. The jurists’ usage of it does not deviate from the linguistic meaning. (Kuwaiti Jurisprudence Encyclopedia, Vol. 12, p. (144).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - What is confirmed for the muhtasib: the prohibition of cheating and under-measuring in weights, scales, and cymbals. He should beware of the measurers and weighers and frighten them with the punishment of Allah Almighty, and forbid them from cheating and under-measuring. Whenever he discovers that one of them has betrayed him, he should admonish him for that and report him, so that others may be deterred by him. (Kuwaiti Encyclopedia of Jurisprudence, Vol. 12, p. (145)</p></div></body></html></div>
