By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if one of them knew that he would find a fat vein or two good spears, he would attend the ‘Isha’ prayer.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 644; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, (15419)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - (His saying: And he is blamed) meaning he is reproached with the letter ta’ and not punished, as he stated in al-Bahr wa al-Nahr. However, in al-Talwih: “Abandoning the confirmed Sunnah is close to being forbidden and deserves to be deprived of intercession,” based on his saying - may the peace and blessings of God be upon him: “Whoever abandons my Sunnah will not attain my intercession.” End quote. And in al-Tahrir: “The one who abandons it deserves to be misguided and blamed.” End quote. What is meant is abandoning it without an excuse by way of insistence (Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, vol. 1, p. 104, publisher: Dar al-Fikr, Beirut).</p></div></body></html></div>
