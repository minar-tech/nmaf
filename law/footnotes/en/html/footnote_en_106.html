If he denies its obligation, he is an infidel who is subject to the ruling of an apostate and must be killed if he persists.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> 2. If he neglects it out of negligence, he is a sinner who is imprisoned and oppressed until he performs it. It was said that he is beaten until blood flows from him, and according to the rest of the schools of thought, he is killed.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> 3. As for the one who neglects to perform the prayer on time, he has sinned (Fiqh al-Ibadat according to the Hanafi school, vol. (71). The one who neglects the prayer intentionally is not killed unless he denies it, but the one who denies it is an infidel because it has been proven by conclusive evidence in which there is no room for doubt, so his ruling is the ruling of an apostate. The one who neglects it intentionally out of laziness is a sinner, and he is imprisoned until he prays. It was said that he is beaten until blood flows from him as an exaggeration of deterrence. If the one who neglected it was a boy and he was ten years old, then beating him would be obligatory for neglecting it, because the Prophet, peace be upon him, said: “Order your children to pray when they are seven years old and beat them for it when they are ten years old” (Majma’ al-Anhar fi Sharh Multaqa al-Abhar, vol. 1, p. 146, publisher: Dar Ihya’ al-Turath al-Arabi).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> The Hanafis said: “A person who abandons prayer out of laziness is a sinner. He should be imprisoned and beaten severely, according to the school of thought, until he bleeds, until he prays and repents, or he dies in prison” (Islamic Jurisprudence and Its Evidence, Vol. 1, p. 578, Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr, Syria - Damascus).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - The third opinion: The one who abandons prayer out of laziness is imprisoned and not killed, but rather he is beaten in prison until he prays. This is what was reported from Al-Zuhri, Abu Hanifa, and Al-Muzani, the followers of Al-Shafi’i. They provided evidence for this with the hadith: “The blood of a Muslim is not permissible to be shed except in one of three cases: a life for a life, a married person who commits adultery, and one who abandons the religion and leaves the congregation.” The one who abandons prayer out of laziness is not one of the three, so his blood is not permissible, but he is imprisoned for refusing to pray until he performs it (The Kuwaiti Jurisprudence Encyclopedia, Vol. 16, p. 302, Al-Rashidiya Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> The Hanafis divided the obligatory ruling into seven categories, which are:</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> 1. Assumption: It is what the Lawgiver has demanded to be done with a definitive demand based on conclusive evidence and indication, such as prayer, zakat, and jihad. Its ruling is that it must be done, and that whoever denies it is an unbeliever, and whoever abandons it without an excuse is a sinner (Al-Wajeez fi Usul al-Fiqh al-Islami, Vol. 1, p. 300, Publisher: Dar al-Khair for Printing, Publishing, and Distribution, Damascus - Syria).</p></div></body></html></div>
