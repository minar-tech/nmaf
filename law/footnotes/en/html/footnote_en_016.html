The basis of this principle is the right of the state to sovereignty over its territory, whether land, water or air. Land territory includes all parts of the geographical borders of the state from the dry land area, and water territory extends to that part of the public sea adjacent to the shores of the state (“Islamic Jurisprudence and its Evidence”, Vol. 8, p. 5973, Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr - Syria - Damascus).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Islamic jurists have unanimously agreed on the necessity of applying Sharia law in the land of Islam to Muslims and others, as is prevalent in the theories of positive laws, including Arab laws, with occasional disagreement in some cases. Our jurists differed among themselves on the extent to which Sharia law should be applied to those who have received protection, which is someone who has entered our land with temporary protection, such as foreigners who enter the territory of another country with an entry visa from the country itself or from its embassies or consulates accredited outside the country. They also differed on the extent to which Sharia law should be applied to crimes committed by citizens of the country outside the country (“Islamic Jurisprudence and its Evidences”, Vol. 8, p. 5973, Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr - Syria - Damascus).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Equality before the law Justice in its comprehensive sense includes this common principle now; because justice, as mentioned above, requires equality in treatment, in the judiciary, in rights, and in the ownership of property. Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, expressed this by saying: “The weak among you is strong in my eyes until I take what is right for him, and the strong among you is weak in my eyes until I take what is right from him, God willing.” And in the famous letter of Omar to Abu Musa al-Ash’ari: “Be fair among people in your face, justice, and your council, so that the noble does not covet your injustice, and the weak does not despair of your justice.”</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - The Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, was keen on attempts to discriminate between people before the judiciary and the Sharia. He said, as narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Aisha, may God be pleased with her: “The reason why those who came before you were destroyed was that if a noble person among them stole, they would leave him alone, but if a weak person among them stole, they would carry out the prescribed punishment on him. By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad, were to steal, I would cut off her hand” (“Islamic Jurisprudence and Its Evidences,” Vol. 8, p. 6208, Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr - Syria - Damascus).</p></div></body></html></div>
