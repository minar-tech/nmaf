I heard the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, say: “Whoever among you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand. If he is unable to do so, then with his tongue. If he is unable to do so, then with his heart, and that is the weakest of faith.” (“Sahih Muslim,” Hadith No. 49, Vol. 1, p. 69, Publisher: Dar Ihya’ al-Turath al-Arabi - Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Since the position of Hisbah is one of the legitimate positions, and it is one of the duties of the Imam, and his delegation to others is a type of delegation, and he carries it out on his behalf, and its nature is based on fear, the extension of the protectors, the authority of the sultanate, and the adoption of assistants, then carrying out Hisbah in his right is one of the individual obligations that are not dropped from him under any circumstances (“The Kuwaiti Jurisprudential Encyclopedia”, Vol. 17, p. (240).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Article 58 of the Majalla al-Ahkam al-Adliya: Disposition of the subjects is subject to the public interest.
