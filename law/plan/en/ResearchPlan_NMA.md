**1. Research Topic:**

- Opportunities for women to work in cultural heritage institutions in Afghanistan.

**2. Research Purpose:**

- The aim is to establish conditions for educational cooperation between the National Museum of Afghanistan and the international museum community.
- This cooperation seeks to strengthen Afghan cultural heritage institutions' ability to protect, preserve, and utilize cultural heritage resources, both in physical museum environments and through digital technology.
- Training is intended to include both men and women.
- The research is framed within cultural diplomacy, aiming to restore and enhance cultural relations with countries previously showing particular interest in Afghanistan and its cultural heritage, such as Japan.

**3. Research Question:**

- Are there legal and theological justifications for women to receive training and work in roles at the National Museum of Afghanistan and other cultural heritage institutions?

**4. Theoretical Framework:**

- Relevant theoretical frameworks include feminist theory, human rights theory, and social justice theory, with Islamic feminism being particularly applicable. However, the main framework selected is *maqasid al-sharia* (مقاصد الشريعة), which refers to the objectives of Sharia, such as the protection of life, intellect, religion, property, and progeny. This framework can be expanded to cover women's rights and is widely accepted within Islamic jurisprudence as a flexible way to interpret religious rules in a modern context.

**5. Applicable Research Methods:**

1. Legislative content analysis, focusing on the law promoting virtues and preventing vices.
2. Analysis of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh analysis) – primarily analyzing the Hanafi school prevalent in Afghanistan, considering the influence of Pashtun culture (Pashtunwali).
3. Qualitative research – interviews with religious and legal authorities.
4. Case study – centered on the National Museum of Afghanistan.
5. Qualitative survey – targeting women who might potentially participate in the planned training. A particular focus is on how Hanafi law and Pashtun culture (Pashtunwali) apply to women, examining their individual opportunities to participate in education and work.

**6. Scope of the Study:**

- All methods listed above provide insights into the research question. However, the analysis will be limited to the first two methods (legislative content analysis and Islamic jurisprudence, specifically the Hanafi school and Pashtunwali). This work forms the foundation for future research utilizing the last three methods.

**7. Materials:**

1. The primary material is the law promoting virtues and preventing vices, along with its Arabic commentary. The law text is 114 pages, written in Dari and Pashto. The footnoted commentary is in Arabic and contains 144 footnotes. My goal is to translate these footnotes and study them alongside the law text, requiring a raw translation of the Dari text as well.
2. My preliminary assumption is that the law clearly expresses restrictions on women but does not specify their freedoms. Answers to this will be sought through a fiqh analysis of the Hanafi school, considering the influence of Pashtunwali.

**8. Conclusions:**

- Conclusions are based on the analysis of the materials presented above (Section 7) using the methods outlined above (Section 5).

**9. Language of the Research:**

- The text will be written in English, but it must be translated into Persian, as the key person at the National Museum of Afghanistan (the current museum director) does not speak English. All communication with him is conducted in Persian.
