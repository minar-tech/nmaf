(Narrated by Al-Bukhari: 5115, Ahmad bin Hanbal: 592, and Al-Tirmidhi: (1121).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> On the authority of Ali, the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, forbade temporary marriage on the day of Khaybar and the meat of domesticated donkeys (Narrated by Muslim: (2511).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - He said - may God have mercy on him -: The invalidity of the temporary marriage and its form is that he says I will enjoy you for such a period of time for such a sum of money (“Tabyeen Al-Haqa’iq Sharh Kanz Al-Daqa’iq wa Hashiyat Al-Shalabi”, Vol. 2, p. 115, Publisher: Al-Matba’a Al-Kubra Al-Amiriya - Bulaq, Cairo). We have the Book, the Sunnah, consensus and reason. As for the Noble Book, the Almighty said: {And those who guard their private parts, except from their wives or those their right hands possess}. God Almighty forbade intercourse except for one of two things, and temporary marriage is neither marriage nor possession, so the prohibition remains (“Badai’ Al-Sana’i’ fi Tarteeb Al-Shara’i’”, Vol. 2, pp. 272-273, Publisher: Dar Al-Kutub Al-Ilmiyyah).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - The evidence that it is not a marriage is that it is terminated without divorce or separation and there is no inheritance between them, so this indicates that it is not a marriage and she was not his wife. And the Almighty’s statement at the end of the verse: {But whoever seeks beyond that - then those are the transgressors} He called the one who seeks beyond that the transgressor, so this indicates the prohibition of intercourse without these two things. And the Almighty’s statement: {And do not compel your female slaves to prostitution}, and that was from them hiring female slaves, Allah the Almighty forbade that and called it prostitution, so this indicates the prohibition (“Bada’i’ al-Sana’i’ fi Tarteeb al-Shara’i’”, Vol. 2, p. 272, Publisher: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - His saying: (And temporary marriage and temporary marriage are invalid), and the form of temporary marriage is that he says to a woman, take these ten days so that I may enjoy you or grant me your privacy for a few days, and it is invalid by consensus (“Al-Jawhara Al-Nayra”, Vol. 2, p. 18, publisher: Al-Matba’a Al-Khayriyah).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - (His statement: The temporary and temporary marriage is invalid) And there is a difference between them in “Al-Nihaya” and “Al-Miraj” that the word “marriage” or “wedding” is mentioned in “Al-Muttaha” and “Al-Muttaha” in that the word “I enjoy you” or “I enjoy” is mentioned in “Al-Inayah” with another difference that the temporary marriage is in the presence of witnesses and a specific period is mentioned in it, unlike the temporary marriage, because if he said “I enjoy you” and did not mention a period, it is a temporary marriage. The truth is what is in “Fath Al-Qadir” that the meaning of the temporary marriage is a contract with a woman that does not mean the purposes of the marriage contract of establishing a child and raising him, but rather either for a specific period at the end of which the contract ends or is not specific in the sense that the contract remains as long as he is with her until he leaves her, so it is included in it by the material of the temporary marriage and the temporary marriage also, so it is one of the individuals of the temporary marriage even if it is contracted with the word “marriage” and witnesses are present until the end of what he mentioned. And it was reported in “Al-Hidayah” that the Companions agreed on its prohibition (“Al-Bahr Al-Ra’iq Sharh Kanz Al-Daqa’iq”, Vol. 8, p. 74, Publisher: Dar Al-Ma’rifah - Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Enjoyment marriage: Jurists call it pleasure marriage. The Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi’is, Hanbalis, and many of the early Muslims have declared this marriage to be forbidden (“The Kuwaiti Jurisprudential Encyclopedia,” Vol. 36, p. (98).</p></div></body></html></div>
