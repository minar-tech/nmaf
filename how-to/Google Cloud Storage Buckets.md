**How can I create two Google Cloud Storage buckets - one for input and one for output of batch translation? Can GitHub pages serve as the input bucket?**

To use Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for batch translation, you’ll need to create two separate buckets: one for your input files and one for the translated output files. GitHub Pages cannot be used as an input bucket, as Google Cloud Translation requires files to be stored in GCS for seamless integration.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to create these GCS buckets and prepare for batch translation:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Google Cloud Storage Buckets

1. **Go to the Google Cloud Console**:
   - Navigate to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

2. **Open the Cloud Storage Section**:
   - In the left menu, go to **Storage** > **Browser**.

3. **Create the Input Bucket**:
   - Click **Create Bucket**.
   - Enter a name for the bucket (e.g., `translation-input-bucket`). Bucket names need to be globally unique, so you might have to try a few names.
   - Choose a region for your bucket that is close to where the translation will occur, for performance reasons.
   - Select a **Standard** storage class for general-purpose storage.
   - Complete the setup and click **Create**.

4. **Create the Output Bucket**:
   - Repeat the same steps to create a second bucket (e.g., `translation-output-bucket`).

### Step 2: Upload Files to the Input Bucket

1. Go to your **input bucket** in Cloud Storage.
2. Click **Upload Files** to add your 144 files. You can upload the `.docx`, `.html`, or converted text files here.

### Step 3: Prepare for Batch Translation

Once you have uploaded the files, you can use the Google Cloud Translation API to specify these buckets as the input and output locations for your batch translation tasks.

#### Note

GitHub Pages is primarily intended for hosting websites and does not support the permissions and integrations required by Google Cloud Translation. Therefore, Google Cloud Storage is the recommended and supported option for both input and output storage locations in this workflow.
