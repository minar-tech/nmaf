But does the prohibition remain after the death of the sultan who prohibited it, such that there is no need for a new prohibition after him? He issued a fatwa in Al-Khayriyah stating that the prohibition must be renewed and that the prohibition does not continue after him, and that if the two parties disagree as to whether it is prohibited or not, then the judge has the final say unless the person against whom the ruling was issued proves the prohibition, and he elaborated on that and spoke well, so refer to him. As for what Sayyid al-Hamawi also mentioned, that he knew from their custom, meaning the sultans of the House of Osman, may God support them, that when a sultan assumed power, he would present to him a law from before him and take his order to follow it, this is of no use here because its meaning is that he would adhere to the law of his predecessors by ordering what they ordered and forbidding what they forbade, and it does not necessarily follow that if he appointed a judge and did not forbid him from hearing this claim that his judge would become forbidden by that alone, but rather it necessarily follows that if he appointed him, he would explicitly forbid him so that he would act according to what he committed to from the law, as is well known that when he appoints him now, he orders him in his proclamation to rule according to the most correct statements of the school of thought as was the custom of those before him, and the full discussion of that is in our book “Tanqih al-Hamidiyya” so refer to it, and we also discussed it at length in our book “Tanbih al-Wali wa al-Hukkam” (Radd al-Mukhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, vol. 5, p. 420, publisher: Dar al-Fikr, Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - They stated that what is permissible in itself may become forbidden by the ruling of the emir, because Allah has commanded obedience to them, saying: “Obey Allah, obey the Messenger, and those in authority among you.” So if the emir sees that he should prevent people from eating something for a clear interest, they must not eat it, and it is forbidden to them. However, this prohibition is limited to the period of his emirate only, and does not extend beyond that, so it is a temporary prohibition. From this chapter is the prohibition of chewing tobacco, as some sultans have prohibited it, so remember it.
