This JSON file represents a **service account key**, which is ideal for programmatic access to Google Cloud services (like storage or translation APIs). `rclone` can indeed use this service account JSON file for access without needing a client ID and client secret for OAuth.

### Steps to Use This JSON File with `rclone`

1. **Configure `rclone` to Use the Service Account JSON**:
   - Open `rclone` configuration:
     ```bash
     rclone config
     ```
   - Choose to add a new remote (`n`), give it a name (e.g., `gcs`), and select `google cloud storage` as the storage type.
   - When prompted for the authentication method, choose **Service Account File** (usually option 5).
   - Enter the path to your service account JSON file, which you can upload to Google Cloud Shell, or point to it if it’s saved locally (e.g., `/path/to/your-service-account.json`).

2. **Use `rclone` to Access Google Cloud Storage**:
   - Now, `rclone` will use the service account credentials to access the bucket. You should be able to copy files with a command like this:
     ```bash
     rclone copy gcs:nmaf_output-bucket C:\Users\mikan\GIT\nmaf\law\footnotes\en
     ```

3. **Upload the JSON File (if needed)**:
   - If you’re working from a local machine and need to provide the file path, you may need to upload it to Cloud Shell first or specify its exact location.

This should allow you to use `rclone` with your Google Cloud Storage bucket seamlessly. Let me know if this setup works for you!
