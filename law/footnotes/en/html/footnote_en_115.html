Do not imitate the Jews or the Christians, for the greeting of the Jews is a gesture with the fingers, and the greeting of the Christians is a gesture with the palms of the hands” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, (2911).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - It is not permissible for a Muslim to make a cross, nor is it permissible for him to order its manufacture, meaning the manufacture of something that symbolizes the cross. He is not allowed to take it, whether he hangs it or sets it up or does not hang it or set it up. It is not permissible for him to display this symbol in the streets of the Muslims and in their public or private places, nor to put it on his clothes, based on what was narrated by Adi bin Hatim (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I had a cross of gold around my neck, and he said: “O Adi, throw away this idol.” And on the authority of Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah sent me as a mercy and guidance for the worlds, and He commanded me to eliminate flutes, musical instruments, idols, the cross, and the commands of the Age of Ignorance.” The cross is disliked on clothing and the like, such as skullcaps, dirhams, dinars, and rings. Ibn Hamdan said: It is possible that it is forbidden, and this is the apparent meaning of what Salih narrated from Imam Ahmad, and the author of Al-Insaf approved it. The evidence for this is the hadith of Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her), which states that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to cut the image of a cross from a garment. In some of its narrations in Ahmad, on the authority of Umm Abd al-Rahman bin Udayna, she said: “We were circumambulating with the Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her) and she saw a woman wearing a cloak with a cross on it. The Mother of the Believers said: ‘Throw it away, throw it away, for whenever the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw something like this on a garment, he would tear it off.” (The Kuwaiti Encyclopedia of Jurisprudence, Vol. 12, p. 88, Al-Rashidiya Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> It is disliked for a person praying to have a cross in his direction of prayer, because it is an imitation of the Christians in their worship, and imitating them in what is reprehensible is disliked, even if he did not intend it (Kuwaiti Jurisprudence Encyclopedia, Vol. 12, p. 88, Al-Rashidiya Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Whoever breaks a Muslim’s cross is not liable for damages, according to consensus. If it belongs to the People of the Covenant, if they display it, then removing it is obligatory, and there is also no liability (Kuwaiti Jurisprudence Encyclopedia, Vol. 2, p. 89, Al-Rashidiya Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> I say: It appears that the cross is included in it, even if it is not a statue with a soul, because it is an imitation of the Christians. And it is disliked to imitate them in something reprehensible, even if one does not intend it, as mentioned above (Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, Vol. 1, p. 479, Rashidiya Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Imitating the people of innovation is forbidden, so it is obligatory to oppose them. I say: The undesirability of imitating the people of innovation is also established among us, but not absolutely, but rather in what is reprehensible and in what is intended to imitate them, as the commentator presented in the chapter on invalidators of prayer (Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, vol. 531, Maktabat al-Rashidiyah).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> It is not permissible to imitate the infidels on their holidays, because of what is stated in the hadith: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” The meaning of this is to repel Muslims from agreeing with the infidels in everything that is unique to them (Kuwaiti Jurisprudence Encyclopedia, Vol. 12, p. 8, Al-Rashidiya Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> It is forbidden for a Muslim to tie a belt around his waist in the manner required of the People of the Covenant, because that is imitating them. The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” This is agreed upon (The Kuwaiti Jurisprudence Encyclopedia, Vol. 24, p. 52, Al-Rashidiya Library).</p></div></body></html></div>
