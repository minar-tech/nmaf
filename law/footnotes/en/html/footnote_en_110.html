(122).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> <strong>A requirement regarding taking from the beard</strong> (his statement: As for taking from it, etc.) With this, what was mentioned was reconciled in Al-Fath with what was mentioned and what is in the two Sahihs on the authority of Ibn Umar on his authority - may God bless him and grant him peace - “Trim the moustache and leave the beard.” He said: Because it is authentic on the authority of Ibn Umar, the narrator of this hadith, that he used to take what was left over from a handful. If it is not taken as abrogation, as is our principle in the action of the narrator contrary to what he narrated, even though it was narrated on the authority of someone other than the narrator and on the authority of the Prophet - may God bless him and grant him peace - leaving it is taken as leaving it without taking most of it or all of it as is the practice of the Magians of the non-Arabs when shaving their beards. This is supported by what is in Muslim on the authority of Abu Hurayrah on his authority - may God bless him and grant him peace - “Trim the moustache and leave the beard, differ from the Magians.” This sentence is in the position of justification. As for taking from it when it is less than that, as some of the Moroccans and effeminate men do, no one has permitted it. Summarized (Radd Al-Muhtar ala Al-Durr Al-Mukhtar, vol. 2, p. 418, publisher: Dar Al-Fikr, Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> (His statement: And it) meaning the prescribed amount for the beard (is a fist) with a damma on the qaf. He said in al-Nihaya: And what is beyond that. This is how it is narrated from “the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, that he used to take from the length and width of the beard.” Abu ‘Eisa - meaning al-Tirmidhi - included it in his Jami’, he narrated it from the hadith of ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (Fath al-Qadir, vol. 2, p. 347, publisher: Dar al-Fikr).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> His saying: (And the Sunnah in it is to hold a handful) which is for a man to hold his beard, and whatever is more than a handful he should cut. This is what Muhammad mentioned in the book of Athar on the authority of the Imam, he said: And this is what we take (Muhit, end of Al-Durr Al-Mukhtar, Vol. 6, p. 407, publisher: Dar Al-Fikr for Printing and Publishing).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> Finally, he stated that it is obligatory to cut off anything that exceeds a handful, with the damma, and that it entails sin in leaving it, not that the obligation is to be taken as proof. As for taking from it when it is less than that, as some Moroccans do, and effeminate men, no one has permitted it, and taking all of it is the action of the Jews of India and the Magians of the Persians (Fath, Commentary on Maraqi al-Falah Sharh Nur al-Idah, Vol. 1, p. 449, Publisher: Al-Matba’a al-Kubra al-Amiriya in Bulaq, Egypt).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> Muhammad ibn al-Hasan said in the Book of Athar: “Abu Hanifa told us on the authority of Abu al-Haytham on the authority of Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) that he used to hold his beard and then cut what was below the fistful.” It was narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Nasa’i in the Book of Fasting on the authority of Ali ibn al-Hasan ibn Shaqiq on the authority of al-Hasan ibn Waqid on the authority of Marwan ibn Salim al-Muqni’ who said: “I saw Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) holding his beard and cutting what was beyond the fistful.” He also said: “Whenever the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) broke his fast, he would say: ‘The thirst has gone, the veins are moistened, and the reward is assured, Allah willing. ’” Al-Bukhari mentioned it in a suspended hadith and said: “Whenever Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) performed Hajj or Umrah, he would hold his beard and cut whatever was beyond that, he would take.” It was also narrated on the authority of Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him, and it was attributed to Ibn Abi Shaybah on his authority: Abu Usamah told us on the authority of Shu’bah on the authority of Umar ibn Ayyub from the descendants of Jarir on the authority of Abu Zur’ah, who said: “Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him, would grab his beard and take what was left over from the handful” (Fath al-Qadir, vol. 2, p. 347, publisher: Dar al-Fikr).</p></div></body></html></div>
