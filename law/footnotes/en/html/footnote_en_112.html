They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever among you takes them as allies, then indeed, he is [one of] them. Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.” (Surat Al-Ma’idah, verse (51)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> God Almighty forbids His believing servants from befriending the Jews and Christians, who are the enemies of Islam and the people whom God will kill. Then He informed us that some of them are allies of others, then He threatened and warned those who do that (Mukhtasar Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Vol. 1, p. 526, Publisher: Dar Al-Qur’an Al-Karim, Beirut - Lebanon).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - “And do not incline toward those who do wrong, lest the Fire touch you, and you will have no protectors other than Allah, and then you will not be aided.” (Hud, verse (113)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> And do not incline toward those who do wrong, meaning do not incline toward them in the slightest inclination, and what is meant by them are the polytheists, as narrated by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim on the authority of Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them both. And inclination is explained as the heart’s inclination toward them with love, and it may be explained with something more general than that, as “those who do wrong” is explained as someone who finds what is called absolute injustice. It was said: And to intend that, He did not say “to the wrongdoers,” and the prohibition then includes flattering them and not changing them when able to, and adorning oneself with their garb, and glorifying their mention and sitting with them without a legitimate reason, and likewise standing up for them and the like (Ruh al-Ma’ani, vol. 1, p. 347, publisher: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, Beirut).</p></div></body></html></div>
