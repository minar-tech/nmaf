Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way.” (Surat Al-Isra, verse (32)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - “As for the adulterer and the adulteress, flog each of them with a hundred lashes. Let not pity for them detain you in the matter of Allah’s religion, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a party of the believers witness their punishment.” (An-Nur, (2)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - On the authority of Zurr, he said: Ubayy ibn Ka’b told me while he was reciting Surat al-Ahzab. He said: I said: Seventy-three verses. He said: Enough. He said: I have seen it and it is equal to Surat al-Baqarah. And we read among what we read in it: “The old man and the old woman, if they commit adultery, stone them both. It is a punishment from Allah, and He is Exalted in Might and Wise.” (Al-Mustadrak ‘ala al-Sahihayn, Hadith No. 8068, Vol. 4, p. 400, Publisher: Dar al-Kutub al-‘Ilmiyyah - Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - On the authority of Abu Hurairah, who said: The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: “The adulterer does not commit adultery while he is a believer” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari: 2475, Muslim: 100, Abu Dawud: 4689, Al-Nasa’i: 7129, Al-Tirmidhi: 2834, and Ibn Majah: (3936).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - On the authority of Sulaym ibn Amir, that Abu Umamah told him that a young boy came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and said: O Messenger of Allah, give me permission to commit adultery. The people shouted, but he said: “Enough!” The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: “Accept him, come closer.” So he came closer and sat in front of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him: “Would you like it for your mother?” He said: “No.” He said: “And likewise, people do not like it for their mothers. Would you like it for your daughter?” He said: “No.” He said: “And likewise, people do not like it for their daughters. Would you like it for your sister?” He said: “No.” He said: “And likewise, people do not like it for their sisters. Would you like it for your paternal aunt?” He said: “No.” He said: “And likewise, people do not like it for their paternal aunts. Would you like it for your maternal aunt?” He said: “No.” He said: “And likewise, people do not like it for their maternal aunts.” The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, placed his hand on his chest and said: “O God, forgive his sin, purify his heart, and protect his private parts” (“Al-Mu’jam Al-Kabir” by Al-Tabarani, Vol. 8, p. 183, Publisher: Ibn Taymiyyah Library - Cairo).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim and others on the authority of Ibn Masoud: “The blood of a man who testifies that there is no god but God and that I am the Messenger of God is not permissible to be shed except in one of three cases: a life for a life, a married man who commits adultery, and one who abandons his religion and separates from the community” (“Ruh Al-Ma’ani”, Vol. 8, p. 67, Publisher: Dar Al-Kutub Al-Ilmiyyah - Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - It is known from the news that the fruits of adultery are ugly, including that it leads to Hell and severe punishment, and that it causes poverty, loss of beauty, and shortened life, and that the like of it is taken from the offspring of the adulterer. When this was said to some kings, he wanted to test it with his daughter, who was extremely beautiful. So he put her up with a woman and ordered her not to prevent anyone who wanted to approach her in any way he wanted. He ordered her to uncover her face, so she paraded with her in the markets, and she did not pass anyone but he lowered his head out of shyness and embarrassment before her. When she paraded with her around the whole city and no one looked at her, she returned with her to the king’s palace, and when she wanted to enter, a man held her and kissed her, then left her. She brought her in to the king and told him the story, so he prostrated in gratitude and said: Praise be to God Almighty, I have never in my life committed anything but a kiss, and I have been cut off by it. We ask God Almighty to protect us, our children, and those who attribute to us indecencies, both apparent and hidden, for the sake of the sanctity of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace.
