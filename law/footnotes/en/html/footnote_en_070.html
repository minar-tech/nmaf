(90).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - He said: It is disliked to hoard the food of humans and animals if it is in a country where hoarding harms its people, and the same applies to receiving. However, if it does not harm, there is nothing wrong with it. The basic principle is the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The importer is provided for and the hoarder is cursed.” Because the right of the public is attached to it, and refraining from selling nullifies their right and makes things difficult for them. It is disliked if it harms them, such as if the town is small, unlike if it does not harm, such as if the city is large, because he is withholding his property without harming others. The same applies to receiving in this detail, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade receiving imports and receiving travelers. They said: This is if the recipient does not give the merchants the price of the town. If he does, then it is disliked in both cases, because he has left them. And hoarding is limited to food items such as wheat, barley, straw and hay, according to the saying of Abu Hanifa (may Allaah have mercy on him). Abu Yusuf (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Everything that is harmful to the public by withholding it is hoarding, even if it is gold, silver or clothing. Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There is no hoarding in clothing. Abu Yusuf, may God have mercy on him, considered the reality of harm as it is the factor that influences the dislike, and Abu Hanifa, may God have mercy on him (Al-Inayah Sharh Al-Hidayah, Vol. 4, p. 92, Chapter on Sale). Publisher: Al-Maktaba Al-Islamiyyah.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Monopoly is disliked, and the discussion of monopoly is in two places: one is in the interpretation of monopoly and what makes a person a monopolist, and the second is in explaining the ruling on monopoly. (As for) the first, it is that he buys food in Egypt and refrains from selling it, and that harms the people, and likewise if he buys it from a nearby place and carries his food to the city, and that city is small, and that harms it, he is a monopolist, and if it is a large city, it does not harm it, he is not a monopolist, and if he brings food to Egypt from a distant place and withholds it, it is not a monopoly (Badai’ al-Sana’i’ fi Tarteeb al-Shara’i’, vol. 5, p. (129). Publisher: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - (As for) the ruling on hoarding, we say: There are rulings related to hoarding, (including) prohibition; because it was narrated from the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, that he said: “The hoarder is cursed and the importer is provided for.” The curse does not apply except by engaging in what is prohibited. It was narrated from him, may God bless him and grant him peace, that he said: “Whoever hoards food for forty nights has disavowed God and God has disavowed him.” Such a threat does not apply except by committing what is prohibited; and because hoarding is a form of injustice; because what is sold in the city has the right of the public attached to it, so if the buyer refuses to sell it when they are in dire need of it, he has denied them their right, and denying the right to the one who deserves it is injustice, and it is prohibited. A short period of detention or a long period is the same in terms of prohibition because injustice is realized. (Among them) is that the hoarder is ordered to sell in order to remove the injustice, but he is only ordered to sell what is in excess of his food and the food of his family. If he does not do so and persists in hoarding and is referred to the Imam again while he persists in it, then the Imam admonishes him and threatens him. If he does not do so and is referred to him a third time, he is imprisoned and disciplined as a deterrent to his bad actions, and he is not forced to sell (Badai’ al-Sana’i’ fi Tarteeb al-Shara’i’, Vol. 5, p. (129). Publisher: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - (His statement: He disliked the hoarding of human food) Hoarding in language means: withholding something waiting for it to go up, and the noun is hoarding with damma and sukoon, as in the dictionary, and in Islamic law: buying food and the like and withholding it until it goes up for forty days, based on the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever hoards from the Muslims for forty days, Allah will strike him with leprosy and bankruptcy,” and in another narration: “He has disavowed Allah and Allah has disavowed him,” he said in Al-Kifaya: meaning He has let him down, and letting down is abandoning support when needed. End quote. And in another: “Then upon him is the curse of Allah, the angels, and all of the people, Allah will not accept from him any charity or justice.” Charity means voluntary, and justice means obligatory (Sharnbalaliyah from Al-Kafi and others), and it was said a month, and it was said more, and this estimation is for punishment in this world in the form of selling and for punishment, not for sin because it occurs even if the period is short and its difference between waiting for his honor or for famine, and we seek refuge in Allah Almighty (Radd Al-Muhtar ala Al-Durr Al-Mukhtar, vol. 6, p. (398). Publisher: Dar Al Fikr for Printing and Publishing, Beirut, Chapter on Selling.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - (It is disliked to hoard human food) such as wheat and the like (and animals) such as barley and straw (in a country that harms its people); because the public right is attached to it. It is restricted by saying that it harms its people; because if the country is large and does not harm its people, then it is not a hoarder; because he has confined his property and there is no harm in it for anyone else (Majma’ al-Anhar fi Sharh Multaqa al-Abharaj 2 p. (547). Publisher: Dar Ihya’ al-Turath al-Arabi.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Monopoly is disliked, that is, buying food in Egypt and refraining from selling it, and that harms the people, as stated in Al-Hawi. And if he buys it in that country and keeps it, and it does not harm the people of the country, there is nothing wrong with it, as stated in Al-Tatarkhaniyyah, quoting from Al-Tajnis from a place close to Egypt, so he carries food to Egypt and keeps it, and that harms its people, so it is disliked. This is the statement of Muhammad, may God have mercy on him, and it is one of the two narrations from Abu Yusuf, may God have mercy on him, and it is the preferred one, as stated in Al-Ghayathiyyah, and it is the correct one, as stated in Al-Jawahir Al-Akhlati (Al-Fatawa Al-Hindiyah, vol. 3, p. 213, chapter on monopoly). Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Monopoly in language: withholding food in order to increase prices, and the noun derived from it is: hoarding ((2). - The first trend: What Abu Hanifa, Muhammad, the Shafi’is and the Hanbalis went to, that there is no monopoly except in food in particular. The second trend: That monopoly applies to everything that people need and are harmed by withholding it, from food, condiments, clothing and other things. This is what the Malikis and Abu Yusuf of the Hanafis went to.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - The third trend: There is no monopoly except in food and clothing in particular. This is a statement by Muhammad bin Al-Hasan (Kuwaiti Jurisprudence Encyclopedia, Vol. 2, p. (92).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - The Muhtasib prevents the hoarding of what people need. Muslim narrated on the authority of Muammar ibn Abdullah al-Adawi that the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: “No one hoards except a sinner.” The hoarder who deliberately buys the food that people need, withholds it from them, and wants to make it expensive for them, is unjust to all people. For this reason, the ruler has the right to force hoarders to sell what they have at fair value, when people need it (Islamic Jurisprudence and its Evidences, Vol. 8, p. (382).
