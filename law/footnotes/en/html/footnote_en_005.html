Omar (may Allah be pleased with him) laid down great rules and principles to keep the workers honest and truthful (“Al-Farouq” by Shibli al-Nu’mani, p. 231, Dar al-Salam for Publishing and Distribution). Details of the workers’ duties according to what was stated in Omar’s (may Allah be pleased with him) orders: Everyone who was appointed as a worker would receive a written order that included his appointment, powers and duties, and the testimony of many Muhajireen and Ansar would be recorded in this order (“Al-Farouq” by Shibli al-Nu’mani, p. 224, Dar al-Salam for Publishing and Distribution).</p></div></body></html></div>
