God Almighty said: “And let there arise out of you a group inviting to good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong” (Al Imran: (104) (“Al-Ahkam Al-Sultaniyyah” by Al Mawardi, p. 349, publisher: Dar Al Hadith - Cairo).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> First - The reality of Hisbah: Definition: Hisbah is enjoining good if it is apparent that it is abandoned and forbidding evil if it is apparent that it is done. Or it is a religious duty, from the category of enjoining good and forbidding evil, which is an obligation on the one in charge of the affairs of Muslims; he appoints for that whomever he deems worthy of it, so it is obligatory to impose it on him, and he takes helpers for that. The Hisbah system was established to implement the duty or principle of enjoining good and forbidding evil stipulated in Islam. It was legislated by Omar bin Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), as he used to personally monitor the conditions of the market to prevent fraud and would patrol at night to check on the conditions of Muslims, resist oppressors and deviants, and track down criminals. However, the name was known during the era of the Abbasid Caliph (“Islamic Jurisprudence and its Evidences”, Vol. 8, p. 6257, Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr - Syria - Damascus).</p></div></body></html></div>
