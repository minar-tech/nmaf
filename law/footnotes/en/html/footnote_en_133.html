As for the captive: Saeed bin Jubair, Al-Hasan, and Al-Dahhak said: The captive is from the people of the Qiblah. Ibn Abbas said: Their captives at that time were polytheists. Evidence for this is that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ordered his companions on the day of Badr to honor the captives, so they would put them before themselves at lunch, and this is what Saeed bin Jubair, Ata’, Al-Hasan, and Qatadah said. (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Salamah edition, vol. 8, p. 288, publisher: Dar Taybah for Publishing and Distribution)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> <strong>- On the authority of Al-Hasan</strong> : The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would be brought a prisoner and he would hand him over to some of the Muslims, and he would say: “Be kind to him.” He would stay with him for two or three days, and he would prefer him over himself. According to most scholars: It is permissible to be kind to the infidels in the land of Islam, but obligations should not be given to them. On the authority of Qatada: Their prisoner at that time was the polytheist, but your Muslim brother has more right to be fed. On the authority of Saeed bin Jubair and Ata’: He is the prisoner from the people of the Qiblah. On the authority of Abu Saeed Al-Khudri: He is the slave and the prisoner. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called the debtor. (Tafsir Al-Zamakhshari = Al-Kashshaf, on the truths of the mysteries of the revelation, vol. 4, p. 668, publisher: Dar Al-Kitab Al-Arabi - Beirut)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> <strong>- The Almighty said</strong> : “And they give food, in spite of their love for it, to the poor, the orphan, and the captive.” Qatada said: God has commanded that the captives be treated well, and that their captives at that time were the polytheists, and your Muslim brother has more right to be fed. (Al-Jami’ li Ahkam al-Quran – Tafsir al-Qurtubi, Vol. 19, p. 126, Publisher: Dar al-Kutub al-Masriyyah – Cairo)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> <strong>Abu Yusuf said</strong> : It is necessary to follow up on the prisoners and look into them without tiring or falling short, and to follow justice with them and not to assault them. The jurists agree that the first thing that the judge should do - when he assumes the position of judge - is to look into the prisons and investigate the conditions of the prisoners. Some of them even went so far as to say that this is obligatory, because imprisonment is a punishment that should be given precedence over everything else.<br /> (Kuwaiti Jurisprudence Encyclopedia, Vol. 16, p. (330)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> <strong>- On the authority of Abdullah</strong> , may God be pleased with him, that the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: “Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. The ruler over the people is a shepherd and is responsible for them. The man is a shepherd over his family and is responsible for them. The woman is a shepherd over her husband’s house and children and is responsible for them. The slave is a shepherd over his master’s property and is responsible for it. Beware, each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock.” (Umdat al-Qari Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari, vol. 13, p. 113, publisher: Dar Ihya’ al-Turath al-Arabi - Beirut)</p></div></body></html></div>
