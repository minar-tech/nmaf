It has ranks, including doing it out of fear of God’s punishment, and doing it out of glorification of God, awe, submission and response, and no matter what happens to him, rather he worships his Lord as if he sees Him, and when he sees Him, all the universes disappear from him and all the things cease to exist (“The Jurisprudential Encyclopedia”, vol. 42, p.
