With your input and output buckets created in Google Cloud Storage, you’re ready to set up and execute your batch translation. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Set Up Google Cloud Translation API

1. **Enable the Cloud Translation API** (if not already done):
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console API library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) and search for **Cloud Translation API**.
   - Click on it and enable it for your project.

2. **Set up authentication**:
   - You should have already downloaded a service account JSON key. Ensure this key is accessible, as you’ll need to set an environment variable pointing to it for authentication.

3. **Set the Authentication Environment Variable**:
   - Run the following command in your terminal (replacing `path/to/your/key.json` with the actual path to your service account key):
     ```bash
     export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/your/key.json"
     ```

### Step 2: Use the Google Cloud Translation API for Batch Translation

You can submit the batch translation job using the Cloud Translation API either through the **Google Cloud Console** or by using **client libraries** (e.g., Python).

#### Option 1: Using Google Cloud Console

1. **Navigate to the Translation Section**:
   - In the Google Cloud Console, go to **AI & Machine Learning** > **Translation** > **Batch Translation**.

2. **Set Up the Translation Job**:
   - Click **Create Translation**.
   - Select **Batch Translation**.
   - Specify the source and target languages (e.g., `ar` for Arabic and `en` for English).
   - For **Input URI**, provide the URI for your input bucket, like `gs://your-input-bucket-name/*` (the `*` wildcard selects all files).
   - For **Output URI**, enter the URI of your output bucket, such as `gs://your-output-bucket-name/`.

3. **Start the Job**:
   - Review the settings, and then click **Start Translation**.

#### Option 2: Using Python Client Library

If you prefer to use Python, here’s a basic code snippet for initiating a batch translation:

   ```python
   from google.cloud import translate_v3 as translate

   # Initialize the translation client
   client = translate.TranslationServiceClient()

   # Set the details for the translation job
   project_id = "your-google-cloud-project-id"
   location = "us-central1"  # Use the location that best suits your setup
   input_uri = "gs://your-input-bucket-name/*"
   output_uri = "gs://your-output-bucket-name/"
   source_language = "ar"
   target_language = "en"

   # Construct the request
   parent = f"projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}"
   input_config = {"gcs_source": {"input_uri": input_uri}}
   output_config = {"gcs_destination": {"output_uri_prefix": output_uri}}
   request = {
       "parent": parent,
       "source_language_code": source_language,
       "target_language_codes": [target_language],
       "input_configs": [input_config],
       "output_config": output_config,
   }

   # Submit the translation job
   operation = client.batch_translate_text(request=request)

   # Wait for the operation to complete
   print("Waiting for operation to complete...")
   response = operation.result()
   print("Batch translation completed.")
   ```

   Replace the placeholders with your actual Google Cloud project ID, bucket names, and other relevant information.

### Step 3: Verify the Translations

1. **Check the Output Bucket**:
   - Once the batch translation completes, go to your **output bucket** in Cloud Storage.
   - You should see the translated files saved in the format specified, typically matching the structure and filenames of your original files.

This setup will help you automate translations for all 144 files at once, saving them directly in your output bucket for easy retrieval and further processing. Let me know if you need more help at any step!
