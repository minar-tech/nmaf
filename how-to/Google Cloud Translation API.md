For your batch translation needs, particularly with Google Cloud Translation Advanced (v3), the recommended choice is **Cloud Translation API**. This is the standard, fully managed translation service that supports batch translations and handles various file types, including `.docx` and `.html`.

Here’s a quick overview of each option to clarify:

1. **Cloud Translation API** (Recommended):
   - Best for general-purpose translations at scale.
   - Supports batch translation, multiple languages, and Google Cloud Storage for input/output management.
   - Ideal for translating documents in bulk, preserving basic formatting.
   - No training is required, making it fast to set up.

2. **Adaptive Translation**:
   - Designed to adapt to specific phrasing based on context over time.
   - Still under experimental development, primarily for interactive applications.
   - Not ideal for bulk document translation tasks.

3. **AutoML Translation**:
   - Allows you to train a custom machine translation model with your data.
   - Useful if you need highly specialized vocabulary or style for industry-specific text.
   - Training a model takes time and resources, so this is less suitable for immediate bulk translation needs unless you need a high level of customization.

4. **Translation Hub**:
   - Aimed at large enterprises needing workflow management and integration.
   - Includes tools for managing translation requests and quality control, which can be useful for teams with specific quality requirements.
   - Likely overkill for straightforward bulk translations.

For your purpose—quickly translating 144 files using predefined translation models—the **Cloud Translation API** is straightforward, reliable, and efficient. This option will allow you to specify your input and output GCS buckets and perform the batch translation seamlessly.
