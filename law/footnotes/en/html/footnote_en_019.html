Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.” (Surat Al-Hujurat, verse (13).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - On the authority of Abu Hurairah, who said: The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: “Do not envy one another, do not outbid one another, do not hate one another, do not turn your backs on one another, and do not undercut one another. Be, O servants of Allah, brothers. A Muslim is a brother to a Muslim. He does not wrong him, does not abandon him, and does not look down on him. Piety is here,” and he pointed to his chest three times. “It is enough evil for a man to look down on his Muslim brother. The blood, property, and honor of a Muslim are sacred to another Muslim.” (Narrated by Muslim: 6706, at-Tirmidhi: 1927, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal: (7713)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Article 58 of the Majalla al-Ahkam al-Adliya: Disposition of the subjects is subject to the public interest. Because the Imam of the Muslims is a general overseer of all the subjects in public affairs... because the Sultan was given authority by God Almighty in order to protect the blood of His servants and safeguard their honor and money (“Explanation of the Majalla” by Salim Baz, Vol. 1, p. (43).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> The relationship of the Imam with the nation or the subjects is that of a faithful servant with his master. He must provide happiness and spread security and prosperity for all, and he must be adorned with the qualities of mercy and sincerity, without coercion or harm (“Islamic Jurisprudence and Its Evidence,” Vol. 8, p. 6313, Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr - Syria - Damascus).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - “And hold fast to the rope of Allah” meaning to the religion of Islam... all together. On the authority of Abu Hurairah, the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: “He is pleased with you with three things and displeased with you with three things: He is pleased with you that you worship Him and do not associate anything with Him, and that you hold fast to the rope of Allah all together, and that you give sincere advice to those who Allah has appointed over you. He is displeased with you over gossip, wasting money, and asking too many questions” (Narrated by Muslim and Ahmad). The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: “Beware of the valleys, and stick to the group and the public” (Narrated by Ahmad). “And do not be divided” (Tafsir al-Mazhari, vol. 2, p. 106, Publisher: Maktabat al-Rashdiya - Pakistan).</p></div></body></html></div>
