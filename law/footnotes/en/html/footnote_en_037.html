If two just men or one just man inform him, and in general everyone whose narration is accepted but not his testimony, then there is a question and possibility regarding the permissibility of attacking his house based on their statement, and it is better for him to refrain because he has the right not to be trespassed on his house without his permission, and the right of a Muslim is not dropped from what his right is proven against him except with two witnesses, so this is the most appropriate thing to be rejected in it.
