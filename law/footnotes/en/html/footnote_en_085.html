That is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what they do. And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts and not display their adornment except that which appears thereof...” (An-Nur, 30-(31).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Ibn Abbas said: God commanded the believing women, when they go out of their homes for some need, to cover their faces from above their heads with their jilbabs and to show one eye. Muhammad bin Sirin said: I asked Ubaidah Al-Salmani about the words of God Almighty: {and to draw their veils over their bosoms}, so he covered his face and head and showed his left eye (“A Summary of Ibn Kathir’s Interpretation”, Vol. 2, p. 114, Publisher: Dar Al-Quran Al-Karim, Beirut - Lebanon).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - On the authority of Aisha, she said: “The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, used to pray the dawn prayer, and believing women would attend with him, wrapped in their cloaks, then they would return to their homes and no one would recognize them” (Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith No. (372).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - On the authority of Umm Salamah, she said: When this verse was revealed, “And to draw their veils over their bosoms,” some women from the Ansar came out as if there were crows on their heads because of the black cloaks they were wearing. Abu Bakr said that this verse indicates that a young woman is commanded to cover her face from strangers and to display modesty and chastity when going out so that people with doubts will not covet them (“Ahkam al-Qur’an” by al-Jassas, vol. 3, p. 486, Chapter on the Hijab of Women, publisher: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, Beirut, Lebanon).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - “The entire body of a free woman is ‘awrah except for her face and hands,” based on the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The entire body of a free woman is ‘awrah except for her face and hands.” The hand is from the wrist to the fingers. He only used the word ‘hand’ and not the hand to indicate that the back of the hand is ‘awrah, because the hand in general is the belly, not the back. In “Al-Bahr” it is stated that the outside of the hand and its inside are not ‘awrah. In “Al-Muntaqa” it is stated that a young woman is forbidden from uncovering her face lest it lead to temptation. In our time, this is obligatory, rather an obligation, due to the prevalence of corruption. On the authority of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her): The entire body of a free woman is ‘awrah except for one of her eyes only, to eliminate necessity (“Majma’ Al-Anhar fi Sharh Multaqa Al-Abhar”, vol. 1, p. 122, Chapter on the Conditions of Prayer, Publisher: Dar Al-Kutub Al-‘Ilmiyyah”).</p></div></body></html></div>
