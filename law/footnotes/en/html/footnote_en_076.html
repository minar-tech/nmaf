This is supported by what is in Sahih al-Bukhari: “On the authority of Jabir that the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, heard him say in the year of the conquest while he was in Mecca: God has forbidden the sale of wine, dead animals, pigs, and idols.” It was said: O Messenger of God, what do you think of the fat of dead animals, for it is used to coat ships, grease hides, and people use it for lighting purposes? He said: “No, it is forbidden.” Hadith (Al-Durr al-Mukhtar and Ibn Abidin’s Commentary (Rad al-Muhtar), vol. 1, p. 331 - Publisher: Dar al-Fikr, Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> He said: “It is disliked to sell weapons to people of discord and to their armies,” because it is assistance in sin (Al-Hidayah fi Sharh Bidayat Al-Mubtadi 576/2 - Al-Haqqaniyyah Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Our companions and others said: Drawing an image of an animal is strictly forbidden, and it is a major sin. Whether it is made for something that is used in a dishonorable manner or for something else, it is forbidden in all cases, because it is an imitation of Allah’s creation. It is the same whether it is on a garment, a rug, a dinar, a dirham, a fils, a vessel, or a wall. As for that which does not have an image of an animal, such as a tree and the like, it is not forbidden, regardless of whether it has a shadow or not. A group of scholars, Malik, al-Thawri, Abu Hanifah, and others, said something similar (Umdat al-Qari Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari, vol. 22, p. 70 - Publisher: Dar Ihya’ al-Turath al-Arabi, Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Our companions and other scholars said: Drawing an image of an animal is strictly forbidden, and it is one of the major sins, because it is threatened with this severe warning mentioned in the hadiths, and whether it is made in something that is dishonored or otherwise, its making is forbidden in all cases, because it is an imitation of the creation of Allah Almighty, and whether it is on a garment, a carpet, a dirham, a dinar, a penny, a vessel, a wall, or anything else. As for drawing an image of trees, camel saddles, and other things that do not have an image of an animal, it is not forbidden. This is the ruling on the image itself. As for making an image that has an image of an animal, if it is hung on a wall, worn on a garment, a turban, or something similar that is not considered dishonored, then it is forbidden. If it is on a carpet that is stepped on, or a pillow, a cushion, or something similar that is dishonored, then it is not forbidden. But does it prevent the angels of mercy from entering that house? There is a discussion about this that we will discuss soon, God willing, and there is no difference in all of this between what has a shadow and what does not. This is a summary of our doctrine on the issue, and the majority of scholars from the Companions, the Followers, and those who came after them said the same. It is the doctrine of al-Thawri, Malik, Abu Hanifah, and others. Some of the Salaf said: What is forbidden is only what has a shadow, and there is nothing wrong with pictures that do not have a shadow. This is a false doctrine; for the curtain in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) denounced the image, no one doubts that it is reprehensible, and its image does not have a shadow, along with the rest of the general hadeeths regarding every image. Al-Zuhri said: The prohibition of a picture is general, as is the use of what it is in, and entering a house in which it is, whether it is a number on a garment or not, and whether it is on a wall, a garment, or a carpet that is used or not used, based on the apparent meaning of the hadeeths, especially the hadeeth of (the carpet) mentioned by Muslim. This is a strong doctrine. Others said: What is permissible is what is a number on a garment, whether it is dishonored or not, and whether it is hung on a wall or not. They disliked what has a shadow, or is pictured on walls and the like, whether it is a number or something else. They cited as evidence his saying in some of the hadiths of the chapter: “Except what is a number on a garment.” This is the school of thought of Al-Qasim bin Muhammad. They agreed unanimously to prohibit what has a shadow, and to require changing it. The judge said: Except what was mentioned about playing with dolls for young girls, and the permission for that, but Malik disliked a man buying that for his daughter. Some of them claimed that the permissibility of playing with dolls for them was abrogated by these hadiths, and Allah knows best (Al-Minhaj Sharh Al-Nawawi li-Sahih Muslim, Vol. 7, p. 205 - Publisher: Dar Ihya’ Al-Turath Al-Arabi, Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - {O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than God], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful.} (Surat Al-Ma’idah, verse (90).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - On the authority of Abu Hurairah, who said: “The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, forbade pouring rum into the open pit, the pitched earth, the gourd, and the hantamah.” He said: “Every intoxicant is forbidden.” (Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith No.: 3401 - Publisher: Dar Ihya’ al-Kutub al-Arabiyyah, Faisal Issa al-Babi al-Halabi).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> Article 34: What is forbidden to take is forbidden to give. Article 35: What is forbidden to do is forbidden to ask for. (Majallat al-Ahkam al-Adliyyah - Publisher: Noor Muhammad, Karakhana-e-Tijarat Books, Aram Bagh, Karachi).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Ibn Abbas said: Wine is forbidden in and of itself, whether in small amounts or in large amounts, and intoxication is forbidden for all drinks (Sunan al-Kubra by al-Bayhaqi). In al-Bahr: Among those who explicitly declared the prohibition of hashish, ganja, and opium is al-Haddadi in al-Jawhara fi Akhir al-Ashribah (Bahr, vol. 3, p. (266). In Islamic jurisprudence: Drugs and intoxicants are of many types, and people are skilled at consuming them under different names. Some of them resort to taking things that achieve the intended goal of clouding the mind, and they all share one ruling, which is prohibition due to the harm they cause, which is certain to occur (Islamic Jurisprudence, vol. 7, p. 5512 - Publisher: Dar al-Fikr, Syria - Damascus).</p></div></body></html></div>
