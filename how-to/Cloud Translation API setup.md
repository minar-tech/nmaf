**Translation Hub** is a fully managed service by Google Cloud designed for organizations that need to translate large volumes of documents into multiple languages. By default, it utilizes Google's Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to perform translations. citeturn0search4

- **Integration with Translation Resources**: Supports the use of glossaries, translation memories, and custom models to enhance translation quality. citeturn0search4

**Considerations**:

- **Pricing**: Translation Hub offers a per-page pricing model, which may differ from the character-based pricing of the Cloud Translation API. citeturn0search4

- **Use Case**: If your primary need is to translate HTML files and you prefer a more hands-on approach with programmatic control, the Cloud Translation API might be more suitable. However, if you require a managed solution with a user-friendly interface for document translation, Translation Hub could be beneficial.

**Recommendation**:

For translating your 144 HTML files into English while preserving their structure, the **Cloud Translation API** is likely more appropriate. It offers flexibility and control, allowing you to automate the translation process programmatically. You can utilize the NMT model directly through this API.

If you decide to use the Cloud Translation API, ensure it's enabled in your Google Cloud project. You can then proceed to set up authentication and implement the translation process as previously discussed.
