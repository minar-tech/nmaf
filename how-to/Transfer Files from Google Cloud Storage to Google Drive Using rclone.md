Yes, you can transfer files directly from **Google Cloud Storage to Google Drive** using **Google Cloud Shell** by integrating **Google Drive as a mount** within the shell environment. While Cloud Shell doesn’t natively support Google Drive, you can use **rclone**, a powerful command-line program that allows access to Google Drive within Cloud Shell.

Here’s how you can set it up:

### Steps to Transfer Files from Google Cloud Storage to Google Drive Using `rclone`

1. **Install rclone in Google Cloud Shell**:
   Run the following command to install `rclone` in your Cloud Shell session:

   ```bash
   curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Configure rclone for Google Drive**:
   - Start the `rclone` configuration process:
     ```bash
     rclone config
     ```
   - Follow these steps in the interactive configuration:
     - Type `n` to create a new remote.
     - Name the remote, e.g., `gdrive`.
     - Select `drive` as the storage type by entering the corresponding number.
     - Follow the prompts to authenticate `rclone` with your Google Drive account. When prompted, `rclone` will provide a URL to visit, allowing you to authorize access. Complete the authorization and enter the code back in Cloud Shell.
     - Leave other settings as default unless you need specific configurations.
     - At the end, confirm the settings and exit.

3. **Copy Files from Google Cloud Storage to Google Drive**:
   - Now that Google Drive is configured as a remote in `rclone`, you can copy files from your Google Cloud Storage bucket to Google Drive.
   - Run the following command, replacing `nmaf_output-bucket` with your actual bucket name and `YourDriveFolder` with the desired Google Drive folder path:

     ```bash
     gsutil -m cp -r gs://nmaf_output-bucket /tmp/output_files
     rclone copy /tmp/output_files gdrive:/YourDriveFolder
     ```

   - This command first copies files from Cloud Storage to a temporary directory (`/tmp/output_files`), then uses `rclone` to transfer the files from that directory to your Google Drive.

4. **Access Files in Google Drive**:
   - Once transferred, you can access the files directly from Google Drive (`drive.google.com`), under the folder you specified (`YourDriveFolder`).

This method lets you use Cloud Shell without Python and achieve the direct transfer of files from Google Cloud Storage to Google Drive. Let me know if you encounter any issues with these steps!
