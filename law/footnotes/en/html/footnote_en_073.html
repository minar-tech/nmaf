(Al-Durr Al-Mukhtar, Vol. 5, p. (101). Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr for Printing and Publishing, Beirut.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> In Islamic law: Increasing the price of a commodity by someone who does not want to buy it so that someone else will buy it. It is called this because the naajsh arouses desire for the commodity. He said in Al-Nihaya: It is to praise the commodity so that it will be spent and promoted or to increase its price while he does not want to buy it so that someone else will buy it. It is used in marriage and other matters. The difference between it and bargaining is that the naajsh does not desire the thing while the bargainer desires it. (Kuwaiti Jurisprudence Encyclopedia, Vol. 37, p. (159).</p></div></body></html></div>
