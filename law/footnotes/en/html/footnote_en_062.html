It was also narrated by Abdullah bin Ja`far Al-Mukhrami and Abdul Wahid bin Abi `Awn, on the authority of Sa`d bin Ibrahim.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> He said: “I advise you to fear God and to listen and obey, even if it is an Ethiopian slave. Whoever among you lives after me will see much difference. So adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-guided caliphs. Hold fast to it and cling to it firmly. Beware of newly invented matters, for every newly invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, hadith no. (4609)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> On the authority of Aisha, may God be pleased with her, she said: The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: “Whoever introduces into this matter of ours something that is not part of it, it will be rejected” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Hadith No.: (2697).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> Abu Dawood narrated the hadith of Aisha, the Mother of the Believers, may God be pleased with her and satisfy her, that the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: “Whoever introduces into our affair something that is not part of it, it will be rejected.” That is, whoever introduces into the religion of God Almighty something that is not part of the religion, but rather is one of the newly-invented matters that the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, warned against.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made clear in this hadith that whatever he innovated is an innovation and is to be rejected, and that adopting it is forbidden, and is a form of adopting falsehood and acting upon what is an innovation in the religion but is not part of it. This hadith is one of the comprehensive words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), for whoever innovates in the religion of Allah something that is not part of it, it is to be rejected, that is, it is to be rejected, and what is to be adopted is what is stated in the Book and the Sunnah (Sharh Sunan Abi Dawud li-Ibad, vol. 515, p. (8).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> Third: Whatever He has given you of obedience to Me, do it, and whatever He has forbidden you of disobedience to Me, avoid it. This was said by Ibn Jurayj.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> Fourth: It is carried on the generality in all of his commands and prohibitions; because he only commands what is good, and only prohibits what is corrupt (Tafsir al-Mawardi, al-Nukat wa al-Uyun, Vol. 5, p. 504, publisher: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah - Beirut / Lebanon).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> The truth is that the imams who are followed in religion are all on the straight path, so whatever school of thought among their schools of thought is widespread in a country and there are many scholars in it, the layman must follow it (I’la’ al-Sunan, vol. 20, p. (290).</p></div></body></html></div>
