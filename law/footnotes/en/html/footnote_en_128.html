They are applied to Muslims and non-Muslims, and the discretionary punishment is appropriate to the crime in terms of severity and weakness and to the criminal’s condition (The Jurisprudential Encyclopedia, Vol. 17, p. (137).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - One of our sheikhs ranked the punishment according to the ranks of people, saying: The punishments are of four ranks: the punishment of the nobles, who are the peasants and leaders, the punishment of the nobles of the nobles, who are the Alawites and the jurists, the punishment of the middle class, who are the common people, and the punishment of the lowly, who are the base people.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - The punishment of the nobles of the nobles is by mere notification, which is that the judge sends his secretary to him and says to him: I have heard that you are doing such and such. The punishment of the nobles is by notification and dragging to the judge’s door and addressing him face to face. The punishment of the middle class is by notification, dragging and imprisonment. The punishment of the lowly is by notification, dragging, beating and imprisonment, because the purpose of the punishment is deterrence, and the conditions of people in being deterred are at these levels (Badai’ al-Sana’i’ fi Tartib al-Shara’i’, vol. 7, p. 64, publisher: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Ta&#39;zir has levels: Ta&#39;zir of the nobles of the nobles, who are the scholars and the Alawites, by informing them, which is when the judge says to them: I have heard that you are doing such and such, so they are deterred by it. Ta&#39;zir of the nobles, who are the princes and the deacons, by informing them and dragging them to the judge’s door and litigating about it. Ta&#39;zir of the middle class, who are the common people, by dragging and imprisonment. Ta&#39;zir of the lowest, by all of this and by beating (Fath al-Qadir, Vol. 5, p. 345, Publisher: Dar al-Fikr).</p></div></body></html></div>
