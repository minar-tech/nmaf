To confirm and activate the **Cloud Translation API** for your project, follow these steps in the Google Cloud Console:

1. **Check if the Cloud Translation API is Enabled**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library).
   - Search for "Cloud Translation API."
   - If it is already enabled, you should see an "API enabled" message. If not, you'll see an option to enable it.

2. **Enable the Cloud Translation API** (if itâ€™s not already activated):
   - Click **Enable** on the Cloud Translation API page.
   - This activation might take a moment. Once enabled, the API will be available for use in your project.

3. **Verify Your Service Account Permissions**:
   - In the **IAM & Admin** section, confirm that the service account associated with your JSON key has the necessary permissions.
   - For batch translation, the service account typically needs the following roles:
     - **Cloud Translation API User**
     - **Storage Object Viewer** (for accessing files in the input bucket)
     - **Storage Object Creator** (for writing translated files to the output bucket)

Once you confirm that the API is enabled, you should be able to proceed with your batch translation setup. Let me know if any issues persist!
