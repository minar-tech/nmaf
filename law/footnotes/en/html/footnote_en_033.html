Indeed, [all] that is of the matters [requiring] determination.” (Luqman: (17) The Muhtasib adds to his commands and prohibitions kindness to others in a way that achieves his goal of obtaining what is beloved and repelling what is hated, for souls cannot endure bitterness except with some kind of sweetness (“Islamic Jurisprudence and Its Evidences,” Vol. 8, p. 6263, Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr - Syria - Damascus).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Enjoining what is right requires five things: First: Knowledge, because the ignorant do not know how to enjoin what is right. Second: That he intends the pleasure of Allah Almighty and to raise His supreme word. Third: Compassion for the one being commanded, so he commands him with gentleness and compassion. Fourth: That he be patient and forbearing. Fifth: That he acts according to what he is commanded to do so that he does not fall under the words of Allah Almighty: “Why do you say what you do not do?” (Al-Saff: (2) (“Al-Fatawa Al-Hindiyah”, Vol. 5, p. 353, Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr).</p></div></body></html></div>
