**Selecting the Appropriate Edition**:

Given your requirement to translate 144 HTML files into English while preserving their structure, the **Cloud Translation - Advanced (v3)** edition is recommended. This edition supports batch processing and offers features that can help maintain the formatting of your documents.

**How to Select the Advanced Edition**:

1. **Enable the Advanced API**:
   - In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), navigate to your project.
   - Go to the **APIs & Services** section.
   - Click on **Enable APIs and Services**.
   - Search for **Cloud Translation API** and ensure that the **Advanced (v3)** version is enabled.

2. **Use the Appropriate Endpoint**:
   - When making API requests, use the v3 endpoint: `https://translation.googleapis.com/v3/projects/{project-id}/locations/{location-id}/translateText`.
   - Replace `{project-id}` with your Google Cloud project ID and `{location-id}` with the appropriate location (e.g., `global`).

3. **Set Up Authentication**:
   - Ensure that your application is authenticated to use the API. This typically involves setting up a service account and downloading a JSON key file.
   - Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to your key file.

**Additional Considerations**:

- **Batch Processing**: The Advanced edition supports batch translation, which is efficient for processing multiple files.
- **Glossaries**: If your documents contain specific terminology, you can create glossaries to ensure consistent translations.
- **Pricing**: Both editions have the same base pricing for standard usage. However, the Advanced edition offers additional features that can be beneficial for complex projects.

By selecting the **Cloud Translation - Advanced (v3)** edition and configuring your project accordingly, you can effectively translate your HTML files while preserving their structure and ensuring quality translations.
