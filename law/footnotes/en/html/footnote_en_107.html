He came and greeted the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said: ‘And upon you, go back and pray, for you have not prayed.’ So he went back and prayed, then he came and greeted the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he said: ‘And upon you, go back and pray, for you have not prayed yet.’ He said the third time: ‘Then teach me, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said: ‘When you stand up to pray, perform ablution completely, then face the qiblah and say Allahu Akbar, then recite whatever you can of the Qur’an, then bow until you are at ease in bowing, then raise your head until you are at ease standing, then prostrate until you are at ease in prostration, then raise your head until you are at ease sitting, and then do that throughout your prayer.” (Ibn Majah, vol. 1, p. (336)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> And whoever abandons it without an excuse is a sinner (Al-Wajeez fi Usul al-Fiqh al-Islami, Vol. 1, p. 300, Publisher: Dar al-Khair for Printing, Publishing and Distribution, Damascus - Syria).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> The ruling is that he deserves punishment for abandoning it, and he who denies it is not considered an unbeliever, and he is rewarded for doing it (Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, Vol. 1, p. 456, Publisher: Dar al-Fikr, Beirut).</p></div></body></html></div>
