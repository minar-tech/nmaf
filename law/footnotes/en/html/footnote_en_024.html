As for merely commanding and forbidding, the boy is not addressed and is not obligated to do that. As for the possibility of the action and its permissibility in his case, it only requires reason. So if he understands the act of worship and knows the reprehensible and the way to change it, then he volunteers it, it is acceptable (“The Kuwaiti Jurisprudential Encyclopedia,” Vol. 17, p.
