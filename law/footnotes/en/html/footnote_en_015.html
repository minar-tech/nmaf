(133).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Ibn Abbas said: Allah commanded the believing women, when they go out of their homes for some need, to cover their faces from above their heads with the jilbabs and to show one eye. Muhammad ibn Sirin said: I asked Ubaidah al-Salmani about the words of Allah the Almighty: “and to draw their veils over their bosoms,” so he covered his face and head and showed his left eye (“A Summary of Ibn Kathir’s Interpretation,” Vol. 2, p. 114, Publisher: Dar al-Quran al-Karim, Beirut, Lebanon).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Aisha said: “The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, would pray the dawn prayer, and believing women would attend with him, wrapped in their cloaks, then they would return to their homes and no one would recognize them” (Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith No. (372).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - On the authority of Umm Salamah, she said: When this verse was revealed, “And let them draw their veils over their bosoms,” some women from the Ansar came out wearing black cloaks with crows on their heads. Abu Bakr said that this verse indicates that a young woman is commanded to cover her face from strangers and to display modesty and chastity when going out so that people with suspicion will not covet them (“Ahkam al-Qur’an” by al-Jassas, vol. 4, p. 486, chapter on the veil of women).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Any clothing that exposes part of a man’s or woman’s private parts is not approved by Islamic law, no matter how beautiful it is... Likewise, clothing that is thin or sticks to the body and tells the viewer the shape of a part of the body that must be covered is subject to what was previously mentioned in terms of prohibition and impermissibility (“Fath al-Mulhim,” Vol. 4, p. (88).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - And her clothing, even if it is attached to her body or thin, looking from behind it is like looking at her body, and looking at the private parts is not permissible except in cases of necessity (“Bazzaziya” on the margin of “Al-Hindiya”, “Ahkam Al-Qur’an”, Vol. 6, p. 370, by the scholar Mufti Shafi’, may God have mercy on him).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - I said: It has become a widespread problem in our country to wear clothes that cling to the body and are thin, and it is not permissible in front of mahrams other than the husband, so how about in front of strangers while people are unaware of it? (“Ahkam al-Qur’an”, vol. 3, p. 383, by the scholar Mufti Shafi’, may Allah have mercy on him). If her dress is thin and shows what is underneath it and is transparent, or it is thick but clings to her body so that her body is visible to him, then it is not permissible for him to look; because if her body is visible, then she is truly clothed in a nude image. The Prophet, may Allah’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: “Allah has cursed those who dress but are naked.” It was narrated on the authority of our Lady Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, that she said: My sister, Lady Asma’, came to me wearing thin Syrian clothes, which today are thin in your view. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah’s prayers and peace be upon him, said: “These are clothes that Surat An-Noor will repel.” So he ordered them to be taken out. I said: O Messenger of God, my sister visited me, so I told her what I said. He said: O Aisha, when a woman menstruates, nothing should be seen of her except her face and hands.
