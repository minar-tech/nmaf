The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: “God has cursed the one who extends hair and the one who has hair extended” (“Al-Bahr Al-Ra’iq Sharh Kanz Al-Daqa’iq,” Vol. 6, p. 88, Publisher: Dar Al-Kitab Al-Islami).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - (Just as it is invalid to sell a child who is not sane or an insane person (something, urine) and human excrement that is not overcome by dirt) so if it is overcome by it, it is permissible, such as dung and dung, and in the sea it is sufficient to simply mix it with dirt (and human hair) for the dignity of the human being even if he is an unbeliever (“Al-Durr Al-Mukhtar”, Vol. 5, p. 58, Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr, Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> The human being is honored by the Sharia, even if he is an unbeliever (this statement was mentioned by the author), where he said: And the human being is honored by the Sharia, even if he is an unbeliever, so forcing a contract upon him and making him look bad and likening him to inanimate objects is humiliating him. End quote. That is, it is not permissible, and some of it is in its ruling, and it was stated explicitly in Fath al-Qadir that it is invalid. (Al-Durr al-Mukhtar, vol. 19, p. 238, publisher: Dar al-Fikr, Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - It is not permissible to benefit from human parts. It was said that it is due to impurity, and it was said that it is due to a miracle. This is the correct view. This is stated in Jawahir al-Akhlati. (“Al-Fatawa al-Hindiyah,” Vol. 5, p. 354, Publisher: Dar al-Fikr).</p></div></body></html></div>
