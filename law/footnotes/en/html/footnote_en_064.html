Whether it is made for something that is used in a dishonorable manner or for something else, it is forbidden in all cases because it is an imitation of Allah’s creation. Whether it is on a garment, a rug, a dinar, a dirham, a fils, a vessel, or a wall. As for that which does not have a picture of an animal, such as a tree and the like, it is not forbidden, whether it has a shadow or does not. A group of scholars, Malik, al-Thawri, Abu Hanifa, and others, said something similar. (Umdat al-Qari, Commentary on Sahih al-Bukhari, vol. 22, p. (70) Publisher: Dar Ihya’ al-Turath al-Arabi - Beirut.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Our companions and other scholars said: “Making an image of an animal is strictly forbidden, and it is one of the major sins, because it is threatened with this severe warning mentioned in the hadiths. Whether it is made in something that is dishonored or otherwise, making it is forbidden in all cases, because it is an imitation of the creation of Allah Almighty, and whether it is on a garment, a carpet, a dirham, a dinar, a penny, a vessel, a wall, or anything else. As for making an image of trees, camel saddles, and other things that do not have an image of an animal, it is not forbidden. This is the ruling on the image itself. As for making an image that has an image of an animal, if it is hung on a wall, a garment that is worn, a turban, or something similar that is not considered dishonored, then it is forbidden. If it is on a carpet that is stepped on, a pillow, a cushion, or something similar that is dishonored, then it is not forbidden. But does it prevent the angels of mercy from entering that house? There is a discussion about this that we will mention soon, God willing. There is no difference in all of this between what has a shadow and what does not have a shadow. This is a summary of our doctrine on the issue, and the majority of scholars from the Companions, the Followers, and those who came after them said the same thing. It is the doctrine of al-Thawri, Malik, Abu Hanifa, and others.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Some of the Salaf said: “What is forbidden is that which has a shadow, and there is nothing wrong with pictures that do not have a shadow.” This is a false doctrine: The curtain in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) denounced the image, no one doubts that it is reprehensible, and its image does not have a shadow, along with the rest of the general hadeeths regarding every image. Al-Zuhri said: “The prohibition is regarding the image in general, as well as using what it is in, and entering the house in which it is, whether it is a number on a garment or not, and whether it is on a wall, a garment, or a carpet that is used or not used, based on the apparent meaning of the hadeeths, especially the hadeeth of (the rug) that Muslim mentioned.” This is a strong doctrine.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Others said: “Whatever is a pattern on a garment is permissible, whether it is used for profanity or not, and whether it is hung on a wall or not. They disliked whatever has a shadow, or is pictured on walls and the like, whether it is a pattern or something else.” They cited as evidence his statement in some of the hadiths of the chapter: “Except whatever is a pattern on a garment.” This is the view of Al-Qasim bin Muhammad. They agreed unanimously to prohibit whatever has a shadow, and to require changing it. The judge said: “Except what was reported about playing with dolls for young girls, and the permission for that.” However, Malik disliked a man buying that for his daughter. Some of them claimed that the permissibility of playing with dolls for them was abrogated by these hadiths, and Allah knows best. (Al-Minhaaj Sharh Al-Nawawi li-Sahih Muslim, Vol. 7, p.
