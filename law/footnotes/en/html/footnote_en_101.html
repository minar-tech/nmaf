Whether it is made for something that is used in a dishonorable manner or for something else, it is forbidden in all cases because it is an imitation of Allah’s creation, whether it is on a garment, a rug, a dinar, a dirham, a coin, a vessel, or a wall. As for that which does not have a picture of an animal, such as a tree and the like, it is not forbidden, regardless of whether it has a shadow or not. A group of scholars, Malik, al-Thawri, Abu Hanifah, and others, said something similar.” (Umdat al-Qari Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari, vol. 22, p. 70, publisher: Dar Ihya’ al-Turath al-Arabi – Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Our companions and other scholars said: “Making an image of an animal is strictly forbidden and is a major sin, because it is subject to this severe warning mentioned in the hadiths. Whether it is made in a way that is dishonored or otherwise, making it is forbidden in all cases, because it is an imitation of the creation of Allah Almighty, whether it is on a garment, a carpet, a dirham, a dinar, a penny, a vessel, a wall, or anything else. As for making an image of trees, camel saddles, and other things that do not have an image of an animal, it is not forbidden.” This is the ruling on the image itself. As for making an image that has an image of an animal, if it is hung on a wall, worn on a garment, a turban, or something similar that is not considered dishonored, then it is forbidden. If it is on a carpet that is stepped on, or a pillow, cushion, or something similar that is dishonored, then it is not forbidden. But does it prevent the angels of mercy from entering that house? There is a discussion about this that we will discuss soon, God willing. There is no difference in all of this between what has a shadow and what does not. This is a summary of our school of thought on the issue, and the majority of scholars from the Companions, the Followers, and those who came after them said something similar. It is the school of thought of al-Thawri, Malik, Abu Hanifah, and others. Some of the early Muslims said, “What is forbidden is only that which has a shadow, and there is nothing wrong with pictures that do not have a shadow.” This is a false school of thought, because no one doubts that the curtain in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) condemned the picture is reprehensible, and its picture does not have a shadow, along with the rest of the hadeeths.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - The apparent meaning of their words here is that politics is an action by the ruler for the benefit he sees, even if there is no partial evidence for that action. (Al-Bahr Al-Ra’iq, a commentary on Kanz Al-Daqa’iq, Manhat Al-Khaliq, and Takmilat Al-Tawri, Vol. 5, p. 11, Publisher: Dar Al-Kitab Al-Islami).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> Absolute in every form. Al-Zuhri said: “The prohibition of the image is general, as well as the use of what it is in, and entering the house in which it is, whether it is a number on a garment or not, and whether it is on a wall, a garment, or a carpet that is being used or not, based on the apparent meaning of the hadiths, especially the hadith of (the carpet) mentioned by Muslim, and this is a strong school of thought.” Others said: “What is a number on a garment is permissible, whether it is being used or not, and whether it is hung on a wall or not, and they disliked what has a shadow, or is depicted on walls and the like, whether it is a number or not.” They cited as evidence his statement in some hadiths of the chapter: “Except what is a number on a garment.” This is the school of thought of Al-Qasim bin Muhammad. They agreed on the prohibition of what has a shadow, and the obligation to change it. Al-Qadi said: “Except what was mentioned about playing with dolls for young girls, and the permission for that, but Malik disliked a man buying that for his daughter.” Some of them claimed that the permission for them to play with girls was abrogated by these hadiths, and God knows best.
