The basic principle is that eavesdropping is forbidden. It was prohibited by the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, who said: “Whoever listens to the conversation of people who hate him or are fleeing from him, molten lead will be poured into his ears on the Day of Resurrection.” And because the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: “Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the falsest of speech. Do not look for faults or spy.” And because people’s personal secrets are respected, it is not permissible to violate them except for a legitimate reason (“The Jurisprudential Encyclopedia,” vol. 3, p. (280).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Al-Mawardi said: The muhtasib is not to investigate what has not been made public of forbidden things. If it is most likely that people are keeping it secret due to an indication or evidence that has appeared, then this is of two types: The first is that it is in violation of a sanctity that cannot be remedied, such as if someone he trusts to be truthful tells him that a man was alone with a man in order to kill him, or with a woman in order to commit adultery with her. In such a case, it is permissible for him to spy and proceed to investigate and search in order to avoid missing what cannot be remedied. Likewise, if a volunteer who is not the muhtasib knows about it, it is permissible for them to proceed to investigate and denounce it. The second type: what falls short of this level, so it is not permissible to spy on it or uncover its curtains. If he hears the sounds of reprehensible entertainment from a house, he may denounce it from outside the house, but he does not have to enter it because the reprehensible thing is apparent and he does not have to reveal what is hidden (“The Kuwaiti Jurisprudential Encyclopedia”, Vol. 17, p. 256, Al-Rashidiya Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - It was mentioned in “Kharat Al-Bazzaziyah” about “Al-Waqa’at Al-Hasamiyyah”: It is preferable to present an excuse for the manifestation of immorality in his home, and if he refrains from it, otherwise the imam will imprison him or discipline him with whips or displace him from his home, as all of these are suitable as punishment (“Al-Durr Al-Mukhtar and Ibn Abidin’s Commentary”, Radd Al-Muhtar, Vol. 4, p. 65, Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr - Beirut).</p></div></body></html></div>
