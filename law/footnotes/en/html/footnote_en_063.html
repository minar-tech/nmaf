Be, O servants of Allah, brothers. A Muslim is a brother to a Muslim. He does not wrong him, nor does he abandon him, nor does he look down on him. Piety is here,” and he pointed to his chest three times. “It is enough evil for a man to look down on his Muslim brother. The whole of a Muslim is sacred to another Muslim: his blood, his wealth, and his honor.” (Narrated by Muslim: 6706, al-Tirmidhi: 1927, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal: (7713)</p></div></body></html></div>
