Likewise, clothing that is thin or sticks to the body and gives the viewer the appearance of a part of the body that must be covered is subject to the ruling mentioned above regarding prohibition and impermissibility (“Fath al-Mulhim,” Vol. 4, p. (88).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - And her clothing, even if it is attached to her body or thin, looking from behind it is like looking at her body, and looking at the private parts is not permissible except in cases of necessity. (“Bazzaziya ala Bamish al-Hindiya,” “Ahkam al-Qur’an,” vol. 6, p. 370, by the scholar Mufti Shafi’, may God have mercy on him).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> I said: It has become a widespread affliction in our country of wearing clothes that cling to the body and are thin, and it is also not permissible in the presence of mahrams other than the husband, so how about strangers when people are unaware of it? (“Ahkam al-Qur’an,” Vol. 3, p. 383, by the scholar Mufti Shafi’, may God have mercy on him).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - If her dress is thin and shows what is underneath it and is transparent, or if it is thick but sticks to her body so that her body is visible to him, then it is not permissible for him to look at her, because if her body is visible, then she is wearing a truly naked image. The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: “May God curse those who dress but are naked.” It was narrated on the authority of our Lady Aisha, may God be pleased with her, that she said: My sister, Lady Asma, came to me wearing thin Syrian clothing, which today you see as thick. The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: “These are clothes that Surat An-Noor will spit out.” So he ordered them to be taken out. I said: O Messenger of God, my sister visited me, and I told her what you said. He said: O Aisha, when a woman menstruates, nothing should be seen of her except her face and hands.
