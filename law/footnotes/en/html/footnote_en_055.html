That is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what they do. ((30) And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts and not display their adornment except that which appears thereof... (An-Nur 24:30-(31)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - The Hanafis in the Sahih, Malikis, Shafi’is and Hanbalis held that a woman’s looking at any part of a foreign man’s body is forbidden if she intended to enjoy it, or she knew or thought it most likely that lust would occur, or she doubted that, such that the possibility of lust occurring or not occurring were equal, because looking lustfully at someone who is not permissible for marriage or right of possession is a type of fornication, and it is forbidden according to all jurists (The Kuwaiti Jurisprudence Encyclopedia, Vol. 40, p. (355), Rashidiya Library, Kuwait.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Based on the correct statement regarding the ruling on a man looking at a woman, the implication of this statement regarding the ruling on a woman looking at a strange man is that it is absolutely forbidden. However, Al-Jalal Al-Bulqini said that none of the companions said this, and the aspects agreed on the permissibility of her looking at a man’s face and hands when there is no fear of temptation. The proponents of this statement provided evidence for this statement by the words of Allah the Almighty: “Tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision.” Allah the Almighty commanded women to reduce their vision as He commanded men. They provided evidence for this by what was narrated on the authority of Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she was with the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and Maymunah when Ibn Umm Maktum came and entered upon him. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Cover yourself from him.” I said: “O Messenger of Allah, is he not blind and does not see us or recognize us?” The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “You are both blind? Do you not see him?” ((2).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - If it were permissible for women to look at men, the Messenger - may God bless him and grant him peace - would not have ordered them to cover themselves in front of Ibn Umm Maktum, who was blind, and he would not have disapproved of them looking at him. (Kuwaiti Jurisprudence Encyclopedia, Vol. 40, p. (357) Rashidiya Library, Kuwait.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> It is forbidden for an adult male to look at the private parts of a free, adult, foreign woman, as well as her face and hands, when there is fear of temptation, and also when there is security, according to the correct view (Al-Minhaj, Vol. 3, p. (128).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> It is permissible to look at the face of a female model, but not a young woman, without an excuse (Mawahib al-Jalil, Explanation of Mukhtasar al-Khalil, Vol. 2, p. 181, Book of Prayer, Chapter on Covering the Private Parts in Prayer.
