This is supported by the hadith in the two Sahihs: “It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to travel for a day and a night’s journey except with a mahram.” In a wording by Muslim: “A night’s journey,” and in another wording: “A day” (“Al-Durr al-Mukhtar and Ibn Abidin’s Commentary” “Radd al-Muhtar,” vol. 2, p. 464, publisher: Dar al-Fikr - Beirut).</p></div></body></html></div>
