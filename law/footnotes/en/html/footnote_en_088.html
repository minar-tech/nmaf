Whoever preserves it and maintains it has preserved his religion. Whoever neglects it is even more neglectful of everything else.” Then he wrote: “Pray the noon prayer when the shade is an arm’s length, until the shadow of one of you is the same length. And the afternoon prayer when the sun is high, white and pure, the distance a rider travels two or three farsakhs, before sunset. And the sunset prayer when the sun has set, and the night prayer when the twilight has disappeared until a third of the night has passed. So whoever sleeps, may his eye not sleep. So whoever sleeps, may his eye not sleep. So whoever sleeps, may his eye not sleep. And the morning prayer while the stars are clear and intertwined.” (Narrated by Imam Malik, may God have mercy on him, in al-Muwatta).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - “The one who intentionally abandons prayer is not killed unless he denies it” (but the one who denies it is an unbeliever because it is proven by definitive evidence in which there is no room for doubt, so his ruling is the ruling of an apostate, and the one who intentionally abandons it out of laziness is a sinner and is imprisoned until he prays, and it was said that he is beaten until blood flows from him as an exaggeration of the deterrent. If the one who abandons it were a boy and ten years old, then beating is obligatory for abandoning it because of his saying, peace be upon him: “Order your children to pray when they are seven years old and beat them for it when they are ten years old”) (“Majma’ al-Anhar fi Sharh Multaqa al-Abhar”, Vol. 1, p. 218, Publisher: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah”).</p></div></body></html></div>
