So it is obligatory, and it is obligatory, to avoid it so that one does not hear what was narrated, “that he, peace and blessings be upon him, put his finger in his ear when he heard it.”</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - (His saying: Ibn Masoud said, etc.) It was narrated in the Sunan with a chain of transmission traceable back to the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, with the wording: “Singing causes hypocrisy to grow in the heart,” as in “Ghayat al-Bayan.” It was said: If one sings to benefit from the arrangement of rhymes and become fluent in speech, there is nothing wrong with it. It was said: If one sings alone to ward off loneliness, there is nothing wrong with it, and al-Sarkhasi adopted this view. Sheikh al-Islam mentioned that all of that is disliked by our scholars, and he provided evidence with the words of God Almighty: “And among the people is he who buys the amusement of speech” (Luqman, (6) - the verse. It was stated in the interpretation: What is meant is singing (“Al-Durr al-Mukhtar” and Ibn Abidin’s commentary on “Radd al-Muhtar”, vol. 6, p. 348, publisher: Dar al-Fikr, Beirut).</p></div></body></html></div>
