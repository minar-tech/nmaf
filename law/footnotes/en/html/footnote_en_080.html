This is a communal obligation. Mosques are the most beloved places to God Almighty on earth, and they are His houses in which He is unified and worshipped (“The Kuwaiti Jurisprudential Encyclopedia,” Vol. 37, p. (195).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Maintaining mosques is commanded by the Holy Qur’an and the Sunnah. It is a communal obligation. If some Muslims perform it, the sin is removed from the rest. If they all abandon it, they are all sinful. Allah the Almighty says: “The mosques of Allah shall be maintained only by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day.” Ibn Kathir said in his interpretation of the verse: “Their maintenance is only appropriate for those who have attained the perfections of knowledge and practice. Part of maintaining them is building them, decorating them with carpets, lighting them with lamps, continuing worship and studying knowledge in them, and protecting them from what they were not built for, such as worldly talk. In the Holy Hadith, Allah the Almighty says: “My houses are the mosques on My land, and My visitors are their maintainers. So blessed is the servant who purifies himself in his house and then visits Me in My house. It is the duty of the one who visits to honor his visitor.” (“The Kuwaiti Jurisprudential Encyclopedia,” vol. 30, p. (299).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - The mosque is for all Muslims, so every Muslim has a way to serve his own interests; because these interests are part of the construction of the mosque. God Almighty said: “The mosques of God shall be maintained only by those who believe in God” (“Bada’i’ al-Sana’i’ fi Tarteeb al-Shara’i’”, vol. 7, p. 279, publisher: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah).</p></div></body></html></div>
