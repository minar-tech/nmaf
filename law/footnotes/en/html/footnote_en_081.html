Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing, and the remembrance of Allah is greater. And Allah knows that which you do.” (Al-Ankabut, (45)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> “Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times.” (An-Nisa’, (103)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> On the authority of Abu Amr al-Shaibani, who said: Abdullah ibn Masoud, may God be pleased with him, said: I asked the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, I said: O Messenger of God, which deed is best? He said: “Prayer at its appointed time.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari: 2782, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal: (4243).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> Abu Al-Darda’ said: I heard the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, say: “There are no three people in a village or desert in whom prayer is not performed except that Satan has taken control of them. So adhere to the congregation, for the wolf only eats the one who strays.” Al-Sa’ib said: He meant by the congregation the congregation in prayer (narrated by Al-Nasa’i: (847).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> On the authority of Abu Razin, on the authority of Ibn Umm Maktum, that he asked the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and said: O Messenger of God, I am a blind man whose house is far away and I have no guide to suit me. Do I have a dispensation to pray in my house? He said: “Do you hear the call to prayer?” He said: “Yes.” He said: “I do not find a dispensation for you.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud: (552)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - On the authority of Abu Hurairah, on the authority of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, who said: “The prayer of a group is twenty-five times better than the prayer of a person in his house or in his marketplace. If one of you performs ablution and does it well and comes to the mosque intending nothing but prayer, he will not take a step but that God will raise him a degree thereby and remove a sin from him until he enters the mosque. And when he enters the mosque, he is in prayer as long as it prevents him, and the angels pray for him as long as he is in the place where he prays: O God, forgive him, O God, have mercy on him, so long as he does not break his ablution therein.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari: 477, Book of the Congregation and the Imamate)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - In “Al-Ghayah” most of our sheikhs said: It is obligatory. In “Al-Mufid” it says: It is obligatory, and it is called a Sunnah because it is obligatory according to the Sunnah. In “Al-Bada’i” it says: It is obligatory for sane, adult, free people who are able to lead the congregation without difficulty (Fath Al-Qadir, Vol. 2, p. 169, Chapter on Imamate).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - As for its description, what he mentioned in his saying: “The congregation is a confirmed Sunnah,” meaning strong, similar to the obligatory in strength, and the most correct opinion among the people of the school is that it is obligatory. He transmitted it in “Al-Bada’i’” from most of our sheikhs, and he and others mentioned that the one among them who says that it is a confirmed Sunnah is not contradicting in reality, but in expression; because the confirmed Sunnah and the obligatory are the same, especially what is from the rituals of Islam. His evidence from the Sunnah is consistency without abandonment, with denunciation of the one who abandons it without an excuse in many hadiths. And in “Al-Mujtaba” it appears that they meant by confirmation the obligation because of their evidence from the reports that came with the severe threat of abandoning the congregation, and he stated in “Al-Muhit” that - “The congregation is a confirmed Sunnah,” based on his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: “The congregation is a Sunnah of guidance, and none abandons it except a hypocrite” (“Al-Inayah Sharh Al-Hidayah,” vol. 2, p. (58).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - The congregation is a Sunnah and no one is permitted to be late for it except with an excuse (“Al-Muheet Al-Burhani”, Vol. 2, p. 136, Chapter on Encouraging Congregation, Publisher: Dar Ihya’ Al-Turath Al-Arabi).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Don’t you see that Al-Karkhi called it a Sunnah and then explained it as an obligation, saying: “The congregation is a Sunnah and no one is permitted to be late for it except for an excuse”? This is the explanation of an obligation according to the general public (“Bada’i’ Al-Sana’i’ Fi Tarteeb Al-Shara’i’”, Vol. 1, p. 155, Publisher: Dar Al-Kutub Al-Ilmiyyah).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - The congregation is a confirmed Sunnah, i.e. close to being obligatory, even if the people of Egypt abandoned it, they would be fought. If one person abandoned it, he would be beaten and imprisoned. No one is permitted to abandon it except for an excuse, such as rain, mud, extreme cold, or extreme darkness (“Majma’ al-Anhar fi Sharh Multaqa al-Abhur,” Vol. 1, p. 161, Publisher: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah, Lebanon, Beirut).</p></div></body></html></div>
