And Allah gives life and causes death, and Allah is Seeing of what you do.” (Al Imran, verse (156)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> God Almighty forbids His believing servants from imitating the infidels in their corrupt beliefs (Mukhtasar Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Vol. 1, p. 330, Publisher: Dar Al-Quran Al-Karim, Beirut - Lebanon).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> On the authority of Ibn Omar, he said: The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them” (Sunan Abi Dawud, Hadith No. 4031, Publisher: Al-Asriya Library, Sidon - Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> Asbagh said: “A man invited Abdullah bin Masoud, may God be pleased with him, to a banquet. When he came, he heard entertainment but did not enter. He said: What is the matter with you? He said: I heard the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, say: Whoever increases the number of people is one of them, and whoever is pleased with the work of a people is a partner with the one who did it.” (Kuwaiti Encyclopedia of Jurisprudence, Vol. 38, p. 178, Al-Rashidiya Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - He is an unbeliever if he goes out to the Newroz of the Magians and agrees with them in what they do on that day, and if he buys something on the day of Newroz that he would not have bought before, out of respect for Newroz, not for food or drink, and if he gives a gift on that day to the polytheists, even an egg, out of respect for that day (Majma’ al-Anhar, Vol. 1, p. 698, Publisher: Dar Ihya’ al-Turath al-Arabi).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - And with the chain of transmission on the authority of Al-Thawri, on the authority of Awf, on the authority of Al-Walid or Abu Al-Walid, on the authority of Abdullah bin Amr, he said: “Whoever builds in the land of the non-Arabs and celebrates their Newroz and their festivals and imitates them until he dies in that state, he will be gathered with them on the Day of Resurrection.” I said: This is as you see in the land of India, where the homes of the people of Islam and the people of polytheism are not mixed in the ancient lands, but rather are distinct and different, so the people of polytheism are not able to display their rituals except in their homes and neighborhoods, not in the homes of the Muslims. So whoever among the Muslims builds his home in the neighborhood of the polytheists in order to imitate them in their festivals, for example, and turns away from the neighborhood of the Muslims, then his ruling is what Ibn Amr mentioned, and its apparent meaning indicates that he made him a disbeliever by participating with them in all of these matters or he made that one of the major sins that necessitate Hellfire, even though the first is the apparent meaning of his wording, so participating in some of that is a sin.” (I’la’ Al-Sunan, Vol. 11, pp. 5496-(5497)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> I say: It appears that the cross is included in it, even if it is not a statue with a soul, because it is an imitation of the Christians. And it is disliked to imitate them in something reprehensible, even if one does not intend it, as mentioned above (Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, Vol. 1, p. 479, Rashidiya Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Imitating the people of innovation is forbidden, so it is obligatory to oppose them. I say: The undesirability of imitating the people of innovation is also established among us, but not absolutely, but rather in what is reprehensible and in what is intended to imitate them, as the commentator presented in the chapter on invalidators of prayer (Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, vol. 531, Maktabat al-Rashidiyah).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> It is not permissible to imitate the infidels on their holidays, based on what is stated in the hadith: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” The meaning of this is to discourage Muslims from agreeing with the infidels in everything that is unique to them (The Kuwaiti Jurisprudential Encyclopedia, Vol. 12, p. -, Al-Rashidiya Library).</p></div></body></html></div>
