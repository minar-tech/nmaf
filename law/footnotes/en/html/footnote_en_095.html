(“Ruh al-Ma’ani”, Vol. 4, p. 411, Publisher: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah - Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - The verses clearly indicate the condemnation and ugliness of sodomy. It is a major sin by consensus, and they stated that it is more forbidden than adultery. The scholar Al-Akmal stated in “Sharh Al-Mashariq” that sodomy is forbidden rationally, legally, and naturally, and that the punishment for it is not obligatory according to Imam Abu Hanifa, may God have mercy on him, because he does not have evidence for that, not because it is light. Some scholars said that the punishment is not obligatory for the sake of severity, because the punishment is purifying. In “Fath al-Qadir” it was said: If it is forbidden by reason and hearing, it will not be in Paradise, and if it is only by hearing, it is permissible for it to be in it. The correct view is that it will not be because God Almighty considered it unlikely and considered it ugly, so He, the Most High, said: {Indeed, you commit an immorality such as no one before you has committed from among the worlds} (Al-Ankabut: (28), and He called it evil, so He, the Most High, said: {She used to do evil deeds} (Ruh al-Ma’ani, vol. 10, p. 361, publisher: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyyah - Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - I say, and it will come in the Book of Coercion, that sodomy is more forbidden than adultery because it is not permitted in any way, and because it is irrational, and therefore it will not be in Paradise according to the correct opinion (Marginalia of “Radd al-Mukhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar”, Vol. 1, p. 297, Publisher: Dar al-Fikr for Printing and Publishing - Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> Jurists unanimously agree that sodomy is strictly forbidden and a major sin. Al-Mawardi said: Sodomy is the most severely forbidden of all indecencies (“The Kuwaiti Jurisprudential Encyclopedia”, vol. 44, p. (23).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - The most perfect scholar mentioned in “Sharh Al-Mashariq” that sodomy is forbidden by reason, law and nature, unlike adultery, and that it is not forbidden by nature, so it was more forbidden than it. Abu Hanifa did not impose the punishment for it because there is no evidence for it, not because it is light, but rather the lack of obligation is to make it more severe for the perpetrator, because the punishment is purifying, according to some scholars. In “Fath Al-Qadir” it was said: If it is forbidden by reason and by hearing, it will not be in Paradise, and if it is only by hearing, it is permissible for it to be, and the correct view is that it will not be because God Almighty considered it unlikely and considered it ugly, so He said: {No one in the worlds has preceded you with it}, and He called it evil, so He Almighty said: {She used to do evil deeds}, and Paradise is free from it (“Al-Bahr Al-Ra’iq Sharh Kanz Al-Daqa’iq”, vol. 5, p. 18, publisher: Dar Al-Ma’rifah - Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - (His saying: And whoever has intercourse with a woman) meaning a foreigner (in a disliked place) meaning her anus (or does the work of the people of Lot, there is no punishment for him according to Abu Hanifa, but he is to be punished and imprisoned until he dies or repents. And if he has become accustomed to sodomy, the imam kills him, whether he is married or not, as a matter of policy. As for the punishment prescribed by the Sharia, it is not a ruling for him, and they said: It is like adultery, and this phrase indicates their admission that it is not from adultery itself, but rather its ruling is the ruling of adultery, so he is to be punished with flogging if he is not married, and with stoning if he is married (“Fath al-Qadir”, vol. 5, p. 262, publisher: Dar al-Fikr).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - He said in “Al-Durar”: “It is like burning with fire, demolishing a wall, and being thrown down from a high place by following stones.” In “Al-Hawi”: “Flogging” is more correct. In “Al-Fath”: He is punished and imprisoned until he dies or repents. If he has become accustomed to sodomy, the imam will kill him politically (“Al-Durr Al-Mukhtar”, Vol. 4, p. 27, Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr - Beirut).</p></div></body></html></div>
