And God knows, while you do not know.” (Surat An-Nur, verse (19)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - His saying: “Synonymous with cuckold.” Al-Zayla’i said: He is the one who sees a man with his wife or his mahram and leaves him alone with her. It was said: He is the one who causes two people to come together for a reason that is not praiseworthy. It was said: He is the one who sends his wife with an adult boy or with his farmer to the farm, or allows them to enter upon her in his absence (“Radd al-Mukhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar,” vol. 3, p. 202, Al-Rashidiya Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - The author mentioned the terms cuckold and qurtban, so he said in “Al-Maghrib”: The cuckold is the one who has no jealousy for someone who enters upon his wife, and qurtban is a bad description of a man who has no jealousy. From Al-Layth and from Al-Azhari: This is from the speech of the urbanites, and I have not seen the Bedouins pronounce it or know it. And from it is what is in the slander of the races, such as “Kashhat.” The commentator mentioned that the qurtban is the one who sees a man with his wife or his mahram and leaves him alone with her. It was said: He is the one who causes two people to come together for a non-praiseworthy reason. It was said: He is the one who sends his wife with an adult boy or with his farmer to the farm, or allows them to enter upon her in his absence. Based on this, he is punished with the word “mu’arras” because he is the cuckold in the Egyptian dialect (“Al-Bahr Al-Ra’iq Sharh Kanz Al-Daqa’iq,” Vol. 5, p. 48, Publisher: Dar Al-Ma’rifah - Beirut).</p></div></body></html></div>
