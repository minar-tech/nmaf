If it is not hidden from the buyer, then it is a lesser sin and a softer denunciation. The buyer should be looked into. If he bought it to sell it to someone else, then the seller should be denounced for his cheating and the buyer for buying it, because he may sell it to someone who is unaware of his cheating. If he bought it to use it, then the buyer is excluded from the group of denunciations and the seller is the only one left. The same applies to deceiving prices. It is forbidden to lick livestock and lick their udders when selling, because it is a type of deception. (Al-Ahkam Al-Sultaniyah by Al-Mawardi, Vol. 2, p. (11)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Fraud: The seller conceals from the buyer a defect in the item sold, which if he had known about, he would not have bought it for that price (Kuwaiti Jurisprudence Encyclopedia, Vol. 7, p. (317).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - (Chapter on the option of defect). (His statement and its interpretation in Fath al-Qadir, etc.) Al-Ramli said: I say that many have interpreted it that way. (Benefit) Some Shafi’is were asked, I say: Ibn Hajar al-Haytami, and it is in his fatwas, about a man who kneads bread for sale and sells it to people, and he is a leper, with itchy and black spots. Is it permissible for him to directly handle the aforementioned bread while it has those characteristics or not? He answered by saying: It is not permissible to sell what he directly handles, such as kneading, unless he explains the true situation to the buyer, because if the buyer knew that, he would not buy it from him in most cases. Everything that was like that is concealed from him from forbidden fraud, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever cheats my nation is not one of me.” (Al-Bahr al-Ra’iq, Sharh Kanz al-Daqa’iq, Minhat al-Khaliq, and Takmalu’ al-Turi, vol. 6, p. (38). Publisher: Dar al-Kitab al-Islami.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - (Warning) Concealing a defect in a commodity is forbidden. According to Al-Bazzaziyah and in the fatwas, if someone sells a defective commodity, he must disclose it. If he does not disclose it, some of our sheikhs said that he is a sinner and his testimony is rejected. Al-Sadr said that we do not accept it. 10 AH.
