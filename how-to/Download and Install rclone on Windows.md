This error occurs because `rclone` is not installed on your local machine. Here are the steps to quickly install it on Windows and complete the authorization process:

### Step 1: Download and Install `rclone` on Windows

1. **Download `rclone`**:
   - Go to the [official `rclone` download page](https://rclone.org/downloads/).
   - Download the Windows version of `rclone`.

2. **Extract and Install**:
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder, e.g., `C:\rclone`.
   - Inside this folder, you should see the `rclone.exe` file.

3. **Add `rclone` to Your System PATH** (optional):
   - To make `rclone` accessible from any command prompt, add `C:\rclone` to your PATH:
     - Open **Control Panel** > **System and Security** > **System** > **Advanced system settings**.
     - Click on **Environment Variables**, then find the **Path** variable under **System variables** and click **Edit**.
     - Add `C:\rclone` to the list and click **OK**.

4. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open a new Command Prompt and type:
     ```bash
     rclone version
     ```
   - If installed correctly, this should display the `rclone` version.

### Step 2: Run the Authorization Command

1. **Run the Authorization Command**:
   - In the Command Prompt, enter the `rclone authorize` command provided by Cloud Shell, which looks like this:
     ```bash
     rclone authorize "drive" "eyJzY29wZSI6ImRyaXZlIn0..."
     ```

2. **Complete Authorization**:
   - Follow the prompts in the browser, authorize `rclone`, and copy the token provided after successful authorization.

3. **Paste the Token Back in Cloud Shell**:
   - Return to your Google Cloud Shell session and paste in the token to complete the setup.
