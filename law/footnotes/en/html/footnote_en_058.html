He said: “O Muammar, cover your thighs, for the thighs are private.” (Musnad of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Hadith No.: (22548).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - “The man’s private parts are between his navel and his knee.” It is also narrated: “What is below his navel until it goes past his knee.” Thus, it is clear that the navel is not part of the private parts, contrary to what Al-Shafi’i - may God have mercy on him - said (and the knee is part of the private parts, contrary to what he also said, and the word “to” we interpret as the word “with” based on the word “until” or based on his saying, peace and blessings be upon him: “The knee is part of the private parts”) (Al-Inayah Sharh Al-Hidayah, Vol. 1, p.
