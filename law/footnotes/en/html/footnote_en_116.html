(290).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> Innovation is basically the creation of something that did not exist at the time of the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace. Innovation is of two types: If it is something that falls under what is desirable in the Sharia, then it is a good innovation. If it falls under what is reprehensible in the Sharia, then it is a reprehensible innovation (Umdat al-Qari Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari, vol. 11, p. 126, publisher: Dar Ihya’ al-Turath al-Arabi, Beirut).</p></div></body></html></div>
