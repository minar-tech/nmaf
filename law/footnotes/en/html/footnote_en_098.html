Ibn Abi Hatim narrated on the authority of his father, on the authority of Abs bin Marhum, on the authority of Hatim, on the authority of Jaafar bin Muhammad, on the authority of his father, on the authority of Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, that he said: Chess is gambling. Ibn Abi Hatim said: Muhammad bin Ismail Al-Ahmasi told us, Waki’ told us, on the authority of Sufyan, that Al-Layth, Ata’, Mujahid, and Tawus said: Everything is gambling, even children playing with nuts. And Rashid bin Saad and Hamza bin Habib narrated something similar, they said: Even the dice, nuts, and eggs that children play with (“Umdat Al-Qari Sharh Sahih Al-Bukhari”, Vol. 18, p. 208, Publisher: Dar Ihya’ Al-Turath Al-Arabi - Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - His saying: “From one side or from a third side” by one of them saying to his companion: If you beat me, I will give you such and such, and if I beat you, I will not take anything from you, or the prince saying to two horsemen or archers: Whoever beats you will get such and such, and if he beats you, he gets nothing (“Ghurar al-Afkar”, “His saying from both sides” by saying: If your horse beats, I owe you such and such, and if my horse beats, I owe you such and such, “Zayla’i”; and likewise if he said: If your camels or arrow beats you, etc. “Tatarkhaniyya”). “His statement, ‘because it becomes gambling,’ because gambling is from the moon, which sometimes increases and sometimes decreases. Gambling is called gambling because each of the gamblers is one of those whose money may go to his companion, and it is permissible for him to benefit from his companion’s money, and it is forbidden by the text. It is not like that if it is stipulated from one side because increase and decrease are not possible in them, rather in one of them the increase is possible, and in the other only the decrease, so it is not gambling because it is a reciprocal action from it (“Zayla’i”; “Al-Durr Al-Mukhtar and Ibn Abidin’s Commentary,” Vol. 6, p. 402, Al-Rashidiya Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - (And if he stipulated in it) i.e. in the competition (“making it from one of the sides” such as if one of them says to his companion: If you beat me, I will give you such and such, and if I beat you, I will not take anything from you, or “he stipulated in it making it from a third party to beat them” such as if a third says to the competitors: Which one of you beats me to such and such, “it is permissible” because it is an incitement to the use of war and jihad, according to the saying of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace: “The believers are bound by their conditions.” And by analogy it is not permissible because it is suspending the money on the prohibition, and according to the three imams it is not permissible in the case of feet.</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - (And if a condition is stipulated by both sides, it is forbidden) by saying: If your horse wins, I will give you such-and-such, and if my horse wins, give me such-and-such, it becomes gambling, and gambling is forbidden unless there is between them “a (permissible) horse that is equal to both of them,” meaning to both of their horses, and he thinks that it will win them (“If it wins them, he takes” the reward “from them, and if they win, he does not give them” anything, or vice versa, meaning he stipulated that if either of them wins, he gives them both, and if he wins, he does not take anything from them, as in “At-Tashil,” and between them: whichever of them wins, he takes “the stipulated money” from the other), because with the permissible, it is no longer gambling, so it is permissible, and if the permissible horse is not like them, it is not permissible because there is no benefit in introducing it between them, so it is not then no longer gambling (“Majma’ al-Anhar fi Sharh Multaqa al-Abhur,” Vol. 2, p. 550, Publisher: Dar Ihya’ al-Turath al-Arabi).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> Jurists agreed on the prohibition of gambling (“The Kuwaiti Jurisprudence Encyclopedia”, Vol. 39, p. 407, Al-Rashidiya Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - What the gambler earns is an evil gain, and it is from the forbidden money like the earnings of the deceiver and the gambler. What is obligatory in the case of evil gain is to release the conscience from it by returning it to its owners if they know, otherwise to the poor (“The Kuwaiti Jurisprudential Encyclopedia”, Vol. 24, p.
