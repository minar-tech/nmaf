But the clothing of righteousness - that is best. That is from the signs of Allah that perhaps they will remember.” (Surat Al-A’raf, verse (26)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> On the authority of Abu Katheer, on the authority of Muhammad ibn Jahsh, who said: “The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, passed by Muammar while I was with him, and his thighs were uncovered. He said: ‘O Muammar, cover your thighs, for the thighs are private’” (Musnad of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Hadith No.: (22548).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - (He refrained from looking at her face) “The permissibility of looking is restricted to the absence of desire, otherwise it is forbidden, and this was in their time, but in our time it is forbidden for young women” (Qahstani and others, Al-Durr Al-Mukhtar, Vol. 9, p. 532, Al-Rashidiya Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Know that covering the private parts outside of prayer in the presence of people is obligatory by consensus, except in certain places. There is a difference of opinion regarding seclusion, and the correct view is that it is obligatory if the exposure is not for a valid purpose. This is stated in the explanation of Al-Muniah (Al-Bahr Al-Ra’iq, explanation of Kanz Al-Daqa’iq, Vol. 1, p. 468, Dar Al-Kutub Al-Ilmiyyah, Beirut, Lebanon).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - (And) the fourth (covering his private parts) “and its obligation is general, even in seclusion, according to the correct opinion, except for a valid purpose” (Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, Vol. 1, p. 404, publisher: Dar al-Fikr, Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> In Al-Muntaqa: “A young woman is forbidden from uncovering her face lest it lead to temptation. In our time, this is obligatory, even an obligation, due to the prevalence of corruption.” And on the authority of Aisha, may God be pleased with her: “The entire body of a free woman is ‘awrah except for one of her eyes, just to avoid necessity” (Majma’ Al-Anhar fi Sharh Multaqa Al-Abhur, Vol. 1, p. 220, Chapter on the Conditions of Prayer). God Almighty bestows His blessings upon His servants by giving them clothing and feathers. Clothing covers the ‘awrah, which are the private parts... Ibn Aslam said: “The clothing of piety is that one fears God and covers his ‘awrah” (Mukhtasar Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Vol. 2, p. 12, Publisher: Dar Al-Quran Al-Kareem, Beirut, Lebanon).</p></div></body></html></div>
