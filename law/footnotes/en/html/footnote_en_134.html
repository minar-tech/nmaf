The wisdom behind his, may God bless him and grant him peace, consulting his companions is that the rulers after him would follow it as an example, not to benefit from their knowledge or judgment. The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, did not need their consultation due to revelation, and consulting them also soothes their hearts, raises their status, and unites them in their religion. Abu Hurairah, may God be pleased with him, said: I have not seen anyone among the people consult his companions more than the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace. (The Jurisprudential Encyclopedia, vol. 26, p. (280)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - And consult them in the matter. And when you have decided, then rely upon Allah. Indeed, Allah loves those who rely [upon Him] (Al Imran: (159).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Because consultation brings together opinions, and the truth becomes clearer when opinions come together, that is why consultation is called: the pollination of minds. So if he consults them, and his opinion and their opinion agree on something, he rules according to it; because when his opinion and their opinion agree, it becomes like consensus, and consensus is one of the arguments. If a difference occurs between those he consulted, he looks to the opinion that is closest to the truth. It was narrated on the authority of Ibn Masoud and Abu Musa al-Ash&#39;ari (may Allah be pleased with them) that they used to write to Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) seeking his advice, and Umar used to write to Ibn Masoud (may Allah be pleased with him) seeking his advice, and Ibn Sama&#39;ah used to write to Muhammad (may Allah have mercy on him).
