In Sharh al-Nuqabah, on the authority of the Imam: It is disliked to shave the back of the head except for cupping. End quote (Marginalia on Maraqi al-Falah, Sharh Nur al-Idah, vol. 1, p. 341, publisher: al-Matba’ah al-Kubra al-Amiriyah, Bulaq, Egypt).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> Ibn Abidin said: Qaza’ is to shave part of the head and leave part of it in pieces the size of three fingers. This is in Al-Ghara’ib. Al-Nawawi said: Qaza’ is to shave part of the head in general. Some of them said: It is to shave scattered areas of it. The legal ruling: The jurists agreed that Qaza’ is disliked, because the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, forbade Qaza’ and said: “Shave it all or leave it all” (Al-Mawsu’ah Al-Fiqhiyyah Al-Kuwaitiyyah, Vol. 33, p. 165, Al-Rashidiyah Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - Al-Tahawi mentioned: Shaving is a Sunnah, and he attributed that to the three scholars. In Al-Dhakhirah: There is no problem with shaving the middle of the head and letting his hair down without twisting it, but twisting it is disliked, because it makes one resemble some of the infidels and Magians in our lands who let their hair down without twisting it, but they do not shave the middle of the head, rather they cut the forelock. Tatarkhani said: It is disliked for qaza’ to shave some of it and leave the rest in pieces the size of three fingers. This is in Al-Ghara’ib. And in it: Some of the early Muslims used to leave their forelocks, which are the ends of the moustache (Radd Al-Muhtar ala Al-Durr Al-Mukhtar, Vol. 6, p. 407, Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr, Beirut).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - It is disliked to shave some of the hair and leave the rest in pieces the size of three fingers. This is in Al-Ghara’ib. And on the authority of Abu Hanifa, may God have mercy on him: It is disliked to shave the back of the head except for cupping. This is in Al-Yanabi’ (Al-Fatawa Al-Hindiyah, Vol. 22, p. 44; and Islamic Jurisprudence and its Evidence, Vol. 1, p. 409, Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr, Syria - Damascus).</p></div></body></html></div>
