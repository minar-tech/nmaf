(“Fayd al-Bari Sharh al-Bukhari,” Vol. 4, p. 320, Mishkat Islamic Library).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - On the authority of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, that the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, sent Muadh, may God be pleased with him, to Yemen and said: “Call them to testify that there is no god but God and that I am the Messenger of God. If they obey that, then inform them that God has enjoined upon them five prayers every day and night. If they obey that, then inform them that God has enjoined upon them charity from their wealth, to be taken from their rich and given to their poor.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari: 1395, Muslim: 130, al-Tirmidhi: 625, and Ibn Majah: (1783)</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - If the benefits and harms come together, and it is possible to achieve the benefits and prevent the harms, then this should be done in compliance with the command of Allah the Almighty, as He says: {So fear Allah as much as you are able} ((4). If prevention is not possible, then the harm should be prevented even if the benefit is lost. Allah the Almighty says: {They ask you about wine and gambling. Say, &quot;In them is great sin and [yet, some] benefit for people. But their sin is greater than their benefit} (5:(17). Wine and gambling are forbidden because their harm is greater than their benefit. If pure harms come together, if it is possible to prevent them, then they should be prevented. If it is not possible to prevent them all, then the more corrupt should be prevented, then the more corrupt, and the more vile, then the more vile. If they are equal, then one may stop, or one may choose, and equality and disparity may differ.
