(251).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - (The three hundred and sixty-second major sin): Lesbianism, which is when a woman does to another woman the same thing that a man does to her. This is what some have mentioned and provided evidence for it with the words of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace: “Lesbianism is women committing adultery among themselves,” and his words: “There are three for whom God will not accept the testimony that there is no god but God: the rider and the ridden, the female rider and the ridden, and the unjust ruler” (“Al-Zawaajir ‘an Iqtiraaf Al-Kaba’ir,” Vol. 2, p. 235, Publisher: Dar Al-Fikr).</p><p style=";text-align:left;direction:ltr"> - It was narrated that Solomon - peace be upon him - said to Satan: Which deeds are most beloved to you and most hated to Allah? He said: If it were not for your status with Allah, I would not have told you. I do not know of anything more beloved to me and hated to Allah than a man being satisfied with another man, and a woman being satisfied with another woman. The first person to teach women lesbianism was the daughter of Satan, whose name was Al-Dulhan. She saw that men were satisfied with men, so she came to the women in the form of a woman and encouraged them to ride each other, and she taught them how to do it. This was said by Al-Tha’labi (“Explanation of Sahih Al-Bukhari” by Shams Al-Din Al-Safiry, Vol. 34, p. (26).</p></div></body></html></div>
