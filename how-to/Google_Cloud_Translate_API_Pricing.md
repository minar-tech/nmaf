To translate your 144 Arabic HTML files into English, preserving their structure, and considering cost-effectiveness, **Google Cloud Translation - Advanced** is a suitable option. Here's a breakdown:

**Google Cloud Translation - Advanced**:
- **Features**: Supports batch translation and document translation, which are ideal for processing multiple files while maintaining formatting.
- **Pricing**: Charges are based on the number of characters processed. As of October 2024, the rate is $20 per million characters for translations using the default Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model. citeturn0search0

**Cost Estimation**:
1. **Character Count**: Estimate the total number of characters across all 144 files.
2. **Calculate Cost**: Divide the total character count by 1,000,000 and multiply by $20 to determine the approximate cost.

**Example**:
- If the total character count is 2,000,000:
  - 2,000,000 characters / 1,000,000 = 2
  - 2 * $20 = $40

**Additional Considerations**:
- **First 500,000 Characters Free**: Google offers the first 500,000 characters per month for free, which can reduce costs if your usage falls within this limit.
- **Batch Processing**: Utilizing batch translation can streamline the process and may offer cost efficiencies.

**Alternative**:
- **Translation Hub**: Designed for large-scale document translation, it offers a per-page pricing model. The basic tier is $0.15 per page per target language, and the advanced tier is $0.50 per page per target language. citeturn0search3

**Recommendation**:
For your project, **Google Cloud Translation - Advanced** is recommended due to its support for batch processing and character-based pricing, which can be more economical for text-heavy documents.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Set Up Google Cloud Account**: If you haven't already, create an account and enable the Cloud Translation API.
2. **Estimate Character Count**: Calculate the total number of characters in your documents to estimate costs accurately.
3. **Implement Batch Translation**: Develop a script to automate the translation of your HTML files, ensuring the preservation of their structure.

By following these steps, you can efficiently translate your documents while managing costs effectively.
