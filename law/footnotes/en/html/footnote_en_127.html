The jurists have said that the muhtasib may take whatever he requires of the matters of hisbah in what he sees as the good of the subjects and the deterrence of the corrupt, and for this purpose - in particular - he has the right to impose a punishment for every sin for which there is no prescribed punishment or expiation, which does not fall within the jurisdiction of the judge. The punishment may be by beating, imprisonment, destruction, killing, or exile (Kuwaiti Jurisprudence Encyclopedia, Vol. 17, pp. 255-(256).</p></div></body></html></div>
